1giw2lr,Advice wanted or Squeezing Tensor Parallelism Performance out of a PCIe lane constrained z690 motherboard,"My AI rig evolved out of pandemic gaming computer, this is what it looks like today:  
MSI z690 with i9-12900K and 192GB DDR5  
4090 -> pcie 4.0 x8  
4090 -> pcie 4.0 x8  
3090 -> pcie 3.0 x4 (nvme to pcie adapter in x4 cpu lane slot)  
3090 -> pcie 3.0 x4 (3rd physical slot on the board)

In tabbyAPI when I set tensor parallelism to true I went from 10 to 15 tokens per seconds with the Q5 quant of Mistral Large. The advice of ""just get an Epyc/Threadripper"" isn't a good fit for me because I also use this system for gaming/VR as well as booting into linux for AI inference.

Case Situation:  
I am in a Lian Li O11 Dynamic EVO XL case with the 4090s in the front compartment, and the 3090s mounted in HDD drive cages above and below the 1600watt power supply. Every bit of space in the setup is very carefully managed.  


Questions:   
If I could change the 2 3090s from being on pcie 3.0 x4 to pcie 4.0 x4 by switching to nvme based oculink adapters that support 4.0, does anyone know how many more tokens per second is reasonable to expect from Mistral Large q5?

Does anyone know of oculink adapters that can be powered off a regular power supply? I see those 24 pin plugs on them, and I'm wary of splitting my main 24 pin power connector off from that. I also see PD options, but I'd really like to keep everything inside this case without having external power bricks hanging off of it.

Similarly, if I did eventually upgrade to a board with four or more pcie 4.0 x16 slots, how much could I expect tokens per second to go up? ",2024-11-03 12:14:30,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1giw2lr/advice_wanted_or_squeezing_tensor_parallelism/
1giuvwm,"Cheap ""Fine-tuning""","Hi. As an oldtimer, my idea of a training set is table of feature vectors (or documents/images) with their corresponding labels. Is this the same format that is used to ""fine-tune"" an LLM?

So far, the most intuitive way to do ""classic supervised learning"" with a LLM for me has been the ""in-context way"", i.e. essentially giving my whole training set to the model inside the context, and then ask it to give me the label for the test sample. This seems very inefficient though, if anything for the long context in every call. There must be a better way. 

What are better ways to have an LLM do supervised classification of a text (for simplicity) document for me, that also does not require GPUs or expensive compute?

Chunking is user-tweakable, for raw data and embeddings. Possible to use local embeddings(HuggingFace/Llama.cpp) or OpenAI. Also has character card support. UI is bad/a placeholder, goal is to get to 'feature completion' and then migrate to FastAPI + Custom JS frontend. Looking to share/get feedback/opinions on it. Goal is to create a tool that can help others save time and keep their data in their hands.  
The tool: [https://github.com/rmusser01/tldw](https://github.com/rmusser01/tldw)

Demo doesn't currently work, (issue with Gradio/HF), plan to setup another one in the next few days, but in the meantime here is a video walkthrough of a fresh installation: [https://github.com/rmusser01/tldw/blob/main/Docs/Screenshots/tldw-run-through-blank.webm](https://github.com/rmusser01/tldw/blob/main/Docs/Screenshots/tldw-run-through-blank.webm)

I started working on a project to help me consume conference presentations at a faster rate, then found out about NotebookLM and thought 'why not extend it to have that featureset?'. Have been working on it for the past several months, and is at a point where I feel slightly more comfortable sharing it. Its open source, licensed under Apache 2.0. Started out as a fork of \`the-crypt-keeper\`'s tldw project for transcribing youtube videos, and has since grown from a 500 line script to a 60k+(?) line application.

Features:

\- API support for 15 different ones, OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Mistral, Groq, and HuggingFace for commercial, Local: Llama.cpp, Kobold.cpp, oobabooga, TabbyAPI, vllm, ollama, aphrodite, custom OpenAI API.

\- Ingest/download/transcribe videos from local files or URLs(yt-dlp is used, so youtube+2k other sites are supported)

\- Same for audio/podcasts/ebooks/plaintext/xml

\- Web Scraping pipeline for individual URLs, sitemap, complete URL(scrape entire root domain), Recursive Scraping(scrape everything under a specific URL)

\- PDF ingestion using pymupdf(Plan is to upgrade it to pymupdf4llm and also integrate docling so the user can decide which works better)

\- Live Transcription/recording

\- Arxiv API integration, so you can search for papers on arxiv and ingest them from the app.

\- RAG Search + Chat - Two current modes, 1 query search and ongoing chatting use RAG with your choice of which DB to use(Media, Conversations, Notes, Character Chats)

\- Note taking in the RAG Chat ala NotebookLM. Have the ability to edit/modify notes + add keyword tagging (with support for meta-keyword collections, WIP)

\- Regular old LLM chat, 4 different UI styles, 2 being vertical/horizontal, the other 2 being 4-API chat, so 4 chat windows with different APIs in one window, and the other is 3 APIs but one prompt, so you can see how different APIs respond to the same input.

\- Character chat support - its no sillytavern, but it has support for character card importing/creation/editing/export. (The eventual goal is to build a replica of the Digital Primer from the Diamond Age)

\- Some basic writing tools for analysis/review

\- Search across it all via FTS5 from sqlite (full text search with keyword support)

\- Prompt DB with the option to add/edit/clone/delete prompts. Also all stored in a separate SQLite DB.

\- Embeddings creation for all/specific content (WIP)

\- Keyword Search/viewing for all DBs

\- Import Functionality - support for mass ingestion of txt/md files as well as obsidian vaults, prompts(single or multiple) and mediawiki dumps

\- Support for exporting it all (Its all SQLite backed anyways, so at worse you could just write raw manual sql queries against the DB)

\- DB Backup/Restore - Support for creating Full/Incremental DB backups (ToDo is writing up a doc explaining how to do invisible/offsite backups with litestream)

\- PlantUML mindmap creator (PoC, but goal is to be able to create mindmaps from your content for review)

\- Anki Deck Creation/Validation/editing - Ability to create a working anki deck, also validate it to make sure it works(?), Editing is in but not working.

\- Support for running/hosting LLMs locally using Llamafile/Ollama

\- Trashcan support for the Media DB to prevent accidental deletion of media items. (15 day period before deletion actually occurs, with the option for manual override)

\- Config Editing page in the app, so you can modify the config file from your browser.

Any feedback is welcome/wanted. The README isn't the greatest, but its on my todo list.

I've been doing geeky stuff for 45 years.  Let that sink in.  Ok, I'm not that old, but the majority of you reading this post won't appreciate dial-up modems, blue-boxing the local payphones or social engineering a sitting president with a nuke warning - while mounted on a Huffy because I couldn't drive yet (and the legal limit was 14 for a learners permit).

That being said, I can say this: I'm impressed.  But also horrified.

**PROS**:

1. The tech is smooth and modern - what's to hate?  (I do have an i9-11xxx with 64GB DDR4, fast NVMe and a 2080 super).
2. The implementation is crisp and aligned with industry trends (RAG, popular model selection and more!)
3. The experience is moderate in terms of learning curve.  My main holdbacks were the 'options', and it's like trying to explain Air-Fuel Ratios to someone who's been working on bicycles their entire life.  Gonna take a second or two, and I'm still only 10% into what I think I know, which means I know precisely squat.  Lots to learn!

**CONS**:

*Safety*.

Safe - how do you keep a hammer safe?  A hammer can be used to both build a house and unalive a person.  I may do both in a 'shit hits the fan situation', but maybe I don't have a hammer and only 12ga shotgun shells, and a horde of zombies are my door?

  
I need to be able to research ANYTHING ... in a potential scenario where I'd like to do something illegal according to normal, customary laws in my supposed jurisdiction.  However, that exact 'thing' I wish to research, is considered 'allowed' in times of crisis or national emergency.

  
While I wish I could lawyer up more (IANAL), I definitely think laws preside and are in effect during 'normal' circumstances.  But when those circumstances \[requiring knowledge\] occur - I won't be very pleased and forgiving if the LLM in which I'm asking questions to save my life or that of someone else - decides I'm flirting with morals.

Examples:

* General, Run of the Mill Extended Beyond 60 Days SHTF \[*morphine from poppies, where to find antibiotics*\]
* Local Supernova / Solar Flare X99 \[*nuclear gamma shielding, how to build a tester*\]
* COVID.next \[*ivermectin information and covid relationship and treatment options*\]
* I AM Legend lion-style attacks \[*expedient firearms and how to defend your yard with booby traps*\]
* Clearing roads after flooding \[*lower order explosives, and how to make detonators*\]



Be scared all you want.  Knowledge is power, and in the right hands, it can save lives.  


**Proposal / Request for Feedback**:

(for GPT4ALL, at least)

A guard-rail free mode?  If the issue of subpoena arises, a download to the Guardrail Free version can be audited, and provided upon proper court subpoena.   The data is incredibly benign, and of no more risk than that of GitHub being breached by a bad actor and all of our emails being (re-re-re-sold) on the darkweb.



...

C'mon for f's sake - this is 2024.  We're not luddites, and knowledge cannot be siphoned.

My motherboard is Gigabyte TRX40 Designare. It has 4 2-slot-width PCIe slots, x16-x8-x16-x8. Parts are (everything except RAM and some PSUs is used, tried to stay on budget):

* 2x3-slot EVGA RTX 3090 (default power limit 350W, never exceeds 275W)
* 2x2 slot ASUS RTX 3090 Turbo,
* 1 PCIe riser cable (Lian Li 60cm, PCIe 3.0 x16).
* daisy-chained PSUs, 1500W and 2000W capable
* Threadripper 3970X
* 8x32 GB of DDR4 RAM
* NVMe 2TB disk (moved to the slot connected to motherboard, in order to free some PCIe lanes for GPUs, just in case)

In BIOS, I have

* Above 4G coding enabled, 48 bits
* Resizable BAR enabled
* CSM support disabled (didn't boot last time I checked with that)
* PCIe set to 3.0 (won't boot otherwise with PCIe resources error BIOS boot code)

The system does not simply boot. GPU->PCIe slots configuration when it at least boots to the state I can SSH into it is

* \------ x16 RTX 3090 Turbo
* \------ x8  RTX 3090 Turbo
* \------ x16 PCIe riser cable -> RTX 3090
* \------ x8 RTX 3090 (it is 3-slot, so this must sit here to not cover any slots - I can interchange anything in slots above however)

This system works fine with 2 GPUs, with some tricks it works with 3 GPUs, although I already have to downgrade PCIe to 3.0.

The problem:

sometimes it boots with all 4 GPUs, then I see 'GPU disconnected/lost from bus' error in dmesg, and there are just 2 GPUs. Sometimes I see 2 GPUs visible at the time of [network.target](http://network.target) passed in systemd (I wrote systemd service to check), one RTX 3090 and one RTX 3090 Turbo, not sure from which slots (I identify them by their max default power in nvidia-smi).

Each of them has idle power (whether 4 or 2 are loaded) at 100W-120W level. Two of RTX 3090 Turbo, which are close in top slots, get temperature of about 70 C in a minute or two just with that. Not sure if this is related, because when they work in tandem (only Turbos), they reach even 90 C without any problem.

Sometimes time before system boots up is exceedingly long - there is some long shutdown happening.

What I tried unsuccessfully:

* limiting power
* setting higher fan speed manually
* limiting clock
* playing with GRUB command line in /etc/default/grub (adviced by Claude AI, don't laugh at me, I was kinda desperate)
* playing with /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf (adviced by Claude AI)
* understanding PCIe lanes map to devices (which I guess is useful, Claude AI taught me the command)

What I am going to try based on my reading from internet:

* install older NVidia driver
* disabled Resizable BAR (it should mostly be used for gaming)
* disable power states of Threadripper (this is probably causing power spikes)
* try to move PCIe riser cable to 1st or 2nd slot (is it will be first, all 3 GPUs will be close, pity for their temps)
* enable CSM again

I am now trying driver reinstall, waiting for reboot to finish.

Any help appreciated...",2024-11-03 05:41:03,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gin2y0/llm_4_gpus_rig_stability_problem/
1gim74q,Current SOTA model for dependency parsing?,"Hi there, I'm struggling to understand which NLP task I need to tackle my problem.

I don't need nothing complicated, basically I have a search engine that will just output a simple string of max 30 words.

From this, I need to understand if the original keyword used for the search, is really meaningful.

Example with ""knife"" as keyword:

* knife to cut bread
* soap to wash knife

In the first case, the subject is knife, in the second is soap; both has knife and I need to narrow the decision to a simple true/false when knife is the subject.

Searching here and there, dependency parsing popped and seems the right way... Yet, I was wondering if that's true and/or if there's something better to accomplish the task via LLM (that is not BERT based thing, albeit I'm open to everything), also because even simplest example with Spacy is failing miserably - but probably it's me, I know that; yet my original question stand still.

1gic7v1,Benchmarked 3090s to find the most optimized power configuration,"I saw the post about optimal power configs a few days ago and decided to go ham with it, so here are my findings:

# Test Setup:

I'm running dual 3090s Turbos in pcie4.0x8 for each card running Qwen 32b at 6\_K\_L at 32k ctx on Ollama. On an optimized setup, tweaking power and core/memory offsets to see how efficiently I could push these GPUs for maximum output.

The test was done using a custom script that ran over 2000 tests (\~20hrs) primarily focused on finding the sweet spot between performance and efficiency, and I monitored parameters like power draw, temperature, and processing throughput.

Script originally ran a broad sweep to find the best broad configurations and then ran fine-grained tests to discover the best overall configurations. Each test configuration was performed twice and then averaged to help eliminate variations.

Prior to the findings, I suspect that either the script or my testing methods errored in the memory configs but I will still continue to test further as lower memory clocks honestly don't track the way I thought they should. Ill probably rerun the tests once I resolve the possible memory offset issue or if I can discover why slower memory clocks are producing better numbers.

I will release the script at some point, but I need to modify it a bit more.

Starting broad sweep configuration: (start, end, step)  
initial\_power = (100, 350, 50)

initial\_core = (1000, 2000, 200)

initial\_memory = (1000, 10000, 1000)

# Key Findings:

After analyzing the data, here's a quick breakdown:

https://preview.redd.it/oojztvn8blyd1.png?width=2750&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cce8b5967ac18a59a11801058ac5babaef91030

1. **Most Efficient Configuration**: This setup drew around 74w per card (pulled from nvidia-smi), kept temperatures around 57°C, and hit a solid 9.82 total tokens/second (total tokens per second is based on, input and output time not just output time, so time to first token is added to the overall efficiency calculation).
   * **Power Limit**: 252W
   * **Core Clock**: 1310Mhz
   * **Memory Clock**: 2650MHz
   * **Efficiency**: 0.132 (best achieved)
2. **Efficiency vs. Power Settings**:
   * Higher efficiency was generally found in the mid-power limit range (240-260W) and with moderate core/memory offsets.
   * Power draw and temperature were relatively stable across configurations, but pushing too high on the memory offset didn’t yield much additional efficiency and only added heat.
3. **Plot Visuals**:
   * Scatter plots showing **Efficiency vs. Power Limit/Core Offset/Memory Offset** and **Temperature vs. Power Draw** (with efficiency as color coding). The results gave a clear visual on which configurations hit the sweet spot.

# TL;DR:

Using Ollama with 2 x 3090s, I found that dialing in around 252W power, 1310 core, and 2650 memory achieved the best balance of efficiency and performance without pushing temps too high.

remember the silicon lottery, your cards may be better or worse in these results.


Edit:

To give a point of reference for how I calculate total tokens per second, Llama.cpp (ollama) with just calculating response tokens and not taking into account prompt processing and other calculation times.

25.2 t/s at 252w (optimized config)

26.6 t/s at 350w (no config)

For me, I prefer Windows and find the macbooks don't suite me (the chassis or trackpad holds static charge or something else which causes hand numbness, tremors, and pain). Flat keyboard deck also = bad ergonomics.

I use gpt4 to help in code generation and learning machine learning etc, but value privacy and control over my documents. Hence why I want to use a local model.

How big of a difference are we talking as far as capable models on a well-speced Windows machine like the Asus proart p16 vs a macbook pro with 30-40gb of ram?

1gi3l2q,Llama 3.1 70B finetune anecdotes on production data processing (2.5B tokens / ~150k requests),"Hey all, I run a website that extracts data from HTML, and part of the pipeline uses an LLM to return data from the HTML in JSON format. I'm a small operation, but larger than most hobby projects, so I figured I'd share my results testing several versions of Llama 3.1 70B over the past month.

Here are the results.

* Llama 3.1 70B instruct - 72% error rate
* Nemotron 70B instruct - 65% error rate
* Dracarys - 38% error rate
* Dracarys2 - 31% error rate

The error rate is an ""all or nothing"" result on 12 datapoints pulled from 120k web pages (split between the models) using the same prompts. A success is any correct exit to the pipeline, where the pipeline either filters the data into stored data or a rejected lot of pages. A failure is any incorrectly collected data or false negative (an incorrectly approved page). I sampled 200 of each LLM's results and manually checked them to determine the rates.

My finding was that for data processing, Dracarys 2 has much better results than more popular open LLMs of the size class. I've also tested proprietary models at lower volumes, and my from-the-hip opinion is it has slightly worse performance than Gemini 1.5 flash and gpt4-o mini for these tasks. Most of its errors related to interpretive issues with unclear data from the pages that would be difficult for a human to figure out.

1gi102k,Introducing Cascade of Semantically Integrated Layers (CaSIL): An Absurdly Over-Engineered Thought/Reasoning Algorithm That Somehow Just… Works,"So here’s a fun one. Imagine layering so much semantic analysis onto a single question that it practically gets therapy. That’s CaSIL – Cascade of Semantically Integrated Layers. It’s a ridiculous (but actually effective) pure Python algorithm designed to take any user input, break it down across multiple layers, and rebuild it into a nuanced response that even makes sense to a human.

I have been interested in and experimenting with all the reasoning/agent approaches lately which got me thinking of how I could add my 2 cents of ideas, mainly around the concept of layers that waterfall into each other and the extracted relationships of the input.

The whole thing operates without any agent frameworks like LangChain or CrewAI—just straight-up Python and math. And the best part? CaSIL can handle any LLM, transforming it from a “yes/no” bot to something that digs deep, makes connections, and understands broader context.

How it works (briefly):

1. Initial Understanding: Extract basic concepts from the input.


2. Relationship Analysis: Find and connect related concepts (because why not build a tiny knowledge graph along the way).


3. Context Integration: Add historical and contextual knowledge to give that extra layer of depth.


4. Response Synthesis: Put it all together into a response that doesn’t feel like a Google result from 2004.


The crazy part? It actually works. Check out the pure algo implementation with the repo. No fancy dependencies,, and it’s easy to integrate with whatever LLM you’re using.

https://github.com/severian42/Cascade-of-Semantically-Integrated-Layers

Example output: https://github.com/severian42/Cascade-of-Semantically-Integrated-Layers/blob/main/examples.md


EDIT FOR CLARITY!!! 

Sorry everyone, I posted this and then fell asleep after a long week of work. I'll clarify some things from the comments here.

1. What is this? What are you claiming?: This is just an experiment that actually worked and is interesting to use. I by no means am saying I have the 'secret sauce' or rivals o1. My algorithm is just a really interesting way of having LLM s 'think' through stuff in a non-traditional way. Benchmarks so far have been hit or miss

2. Does it work? Is the code crap?: it does work! And yes, the code is ugly. I created this in 2 days with the help of Claude while working my day job.
 

3. No paper? Fake paper?: There is no official paper but there is the random one in the repo. What is that? Well, part of my new workflow I was testing that helped start this codebase. Part of this project was to eventually showcase how I built an agent based workflow that allows me to take an idea, have a semi-decent/random 'research' paper written by those agents. I then take that and run it into another agent team that translates it into a starting code base for me to see if I can actually get working. This one did.


4. Examples?: There is an example in the repo but I will try and put together some more definitive and useful. For now, take a look at the repo and give it a shot. Easy set up for the most part. Will make a UI also for those non coders

1ghvwsj,llama.cpp Compute and Memory Bandwidth Efficiency w/ Different Devices/Backends,"One of the things that I noticed from my [recent Intel Xe2 iGPU testing with llama.cpp](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gheslj/testing_llamacpp_with_intels_xe2_igpu_core_ultra/) was that theoretical max FP16 TFLOPS and MBW only told a part of the story.

I thought I'd share these numbers since it's pretty interesting to see how TFLOPS and MBW are actually only one part of the equation, and there's a huge variance in t/TFLOP efficiency and MBW efficiency between backends and devices (the CUDA backend looks to be the most optimized for both Ampere and Ada devices):

* \^ The M3 Metal numbers are from the [official llama.cpp Apple Silicon performance discussion thread](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions/4167), M2 10 CU results closely match my M2 MBA results so I assume they're up to date
* The rest of the numbers are from tests I ran with very recent builds of `llama.cpp` (b4008-4011) on various Linux systems (Arch, CachyOS, Ubuntu 24.04 TLS)
* All tests were done with the Q4\_0 quant of [https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGUF)
* The pp/tg numbers are generated from `llama-bench`, typically with no additonal options. CUDA runs are with `-fa 1` (which gives a decent boost) for Nvidia cards
* While max theoretical MBW is pretty straightforward, the max (Tensor FP16) TFLOPS can be trickier (dependent on the actual clock speeds, so they should be treated more as just a ballpark number) - it's worth noting that some listings, like TechPowerUp's TFLOPS numbers can be very misleading since they don't properly account for tensor/vector engines like Tensor cores or XMX, etc. (also CPU depends on vector support, is not so straightforward either - here's a sample of [using o1-preview to sanity check my 3050 and EPYC TFLOPS estimates](https://chatgpt.com/share/6726210e-1100-8012-8953-bedb79f9211b)).

One thing of interest is seeing how efficient in terms of tokens/FP16 TFLOP the CUDA backend is - this applies to Ampere (3rd gen) and Ada (4th gen) tensor cores. I'm pretty sure I'm doing the math right here, I think the CUDA implementation is just that good.

In any case, I figure I'd kick off a thread for future reference, and in case anyone wanted to contribute the numbers for their particular setup. You can just post to the thread and maybe it'll be a fun/useful resource. Suggestions:

* include llama.cpp build # (use the monotonic number, the sha1 is much harder to track)
* use the same GGUF for easy comparison (Q4\_0 is recommended since every backend supports that)
* t/TFLOPS is just (`pp512 / TFLOPS`)
* MBW % is `100 * tg128 / (MBW/3.56) )` (the llama2 q4\_0 is 3.56GB)

UPDATE: I had Claude [make a visualization](https://claude.site/artifacts/f111e143-f9a0-44b2-ae37-e2457b27e525), colored Backend to maybe better illustrate how different HW/backends stack up in terms of compute and memory bandwidth efficiency:

1ghtqay,Is Long Context Finetuning on theses even a good idea?,"I'm trying to figure out my friend's and my masters thesis. The only condition is for us to use a dataset of about 300,000 PhD theses because that gets us a scholarship.

**Idea:**

My thought process so far has been: Large Datasets are good for training/finetuning -> Training is only for big corp -> For finetuning you need labled data -> We can use the Abstract as label for the document -> Finetune on the task of writing Abstracts -> Create some kind of benchmark to measure performance (of other models, too)

**Context and Memory Problem:**

The pdfs are usually 150-300 pages and we expect them to be 100-200K tokens (we can filter out the long ones, 300,000 is way too much anyway)

Now we've researched finetuning a bit and found out the memory requirement scales quadratically by context length. Even when I select QLoRa at [https://rahulschand.github.io/gpu\_poor/](https://rahulschand.github.io/gpu_poor/) the memory requirement is insane. Now Unsloth supposedly enables Long Contexts [https://unsloth.ai/blog/long-context](https://unsloth.ai/blog/long-context) for mortals. The max setup we can get is 8x Nvidia Tesla A30 (24GB).

Does anyone have experience finetuning on such long sequences?

The other issue is that summarization is kind of considered a ""solved problem"" in AI but when we tried Llama3.2 3B on our data it was pretty bad. Will the tuning even improve this performance? If you have any other ideas for scientific use cases of the dataset let me know",2024-11-02 03:46:22,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ghtqay/is_long_context_finetuning_on_theses_even_a_good/
1ghtnb7,[TIP] Speed Up Your Model Loading Times with vmtouch on Linux,"Hey Linux/WSL folks!

If like me you frequently swap between large models during your workflow, consider trying out vmtouch! It’s a handy tool that allows you to precache files into memory, which could reduce GPU loading times significantly.

I personally saw my model loading times cut in half, even though I’m using an NVMe drive. Here’s how you can set it up in just a few commands:

Install vmtouch:

`sudo apt-get install vmtouch`

Cache models into memory:

`# Replace /path/to/model_directory with your model folder paths.`  
`sudo vmtouch -dl /path/to/model_directory`  
`sudo vmtouch -dl /path/to/another_model_directory`

1ghsvk3,BitStack: Fine-Grained Size Control for Compressed Large Language Models in Variable Memory Environments,"[Link to the Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23918)

[Github Repo](https://github.com/xinghaow99/BitStack)

>  
Abstract:  
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications, yet their deployment remains challenged by memory constraints on local devices. While scaling laws have enhanced LLM capabilities, the primary bottleneck has shifted from capability to availability, emphasizing the need for efficient memory management. Traditional compression methods, such as quantization, often require predefined compression ratios and separate compression processes for each setting, complicating deployment in variable memory environments. In this paper, we introduce BitStack, a novel, training-free weight compression approach that enables megabyte-level trade-offs between memory usage and model performance. By leveraging weight decomposition, BitStack can dynamically adjust the model size with minimal transmission between running memory and storage devices. Our approach iteratively decomposes weight matrices while considering the significance of each parameter, resulting in an approximately 1-bit per parameter residual block in each decomposition iteration. These blocks are sorted and stacked in storage as basic transmission units, with different quantities loaded based on current memory availability. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that, despite offering fine-grained size control, BitStack consistently matches or surpasses strong quantization baselines, particularly at extreme compression ratios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decomposition-based method that effectively bridges the gap to practical compression techniques like quantization. Code is available at https://github.com/xinghaow99/BitStack.

tl;dr: This paper introduces a method called BitStack, which is a model compression technique that can dynamically balance memory and performance, for example when more memory is available, it can switch to a higher ""quant"". So it divides the model into blocks and those blocks can be selectively loaded depending on the performance requirements or memory availability. More blocks -> Better performance.",2024-11-02 02:42:56,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ghsvk3/bitstack_finegrained_size_control_for_compressed/

Those who now have 7900 XTX what is the biggest problem (compared to nvidia) with the card related to running LLM (not training) ? 

Does 7900 xtx use how much more power when its fully utilized than nvidia 4090? 
I have heard idle is about 20W with one monitor but what about zero monitors attached? 4090 idle was something like 10W

Does it work with vLLM?

1ghmq4k,Fine tune or rag?,"So I have a dataset of 300 samples of text mapped to code. That code is limited in the sense that they are some basic lines of codes that are not going to be changed for later inference. To be more precise if I have those 300 lines of code, with their text description, then for inference, we're expecting one of those lines given the parameters provided in the text. For example: `(""print the first index of this string s"", ""print(s[0])"")`, this is just a hypothetical example. What we expect, is an inference for something like: `""display the 0 index of string j""` to give `""print(j[0])""` .

There are two ways to go about this, either to fine-tune an llm, preferably smaller one, while increasing the model complexity if the smaller one works but doesn't capture all of the complexity.

Or, we do RAG, because basically we're doing knowledge here to be memorized, and basically for inference, we're just asking for one of those patterns in the initial dataset, and thus it s more of a knowledge memory.

      model = load_model()
      print(""Model loaded. Starting chat."")
      chat_loop(model)
    
    
    

Which gave me about **7 token/s**

I then tried using LLM Studio, with the exact same model and the exact same quantization (making sure it's Qwen's repository and not Bartowski's version, etc..., it's the exact same model) and with LLM Studio I reach **90 token/s** which is 10+ times faster.  
  
Could someone enlighten me as to why there is such a difference between the two? The settings are exactly the same (context size, batch size, full GPU offloading (28 layers out of 28 on LLM Studio and n\_gpu\_layers=-1 in the code) so I am a bit troubled by the differences. 

On a similar note, inside LLM Studio I've also noticed insane differences in terms of token speed for the same model with the same quantization, for instance Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF Q4\_0 gives me **80 t/s** in LLM Studio but bartowski/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF Q4\_0 gives me **3.5 t/s** in LLM Studio.  
Why am I seeing such big differences even inside LLM Studio for the same model with the same quanitization? Am I missing something?

Chips and Chesee did some [preliminary MBW testing](https://chipsandcheese.com/i/149978169/cache-and-memory-bandwidth) and found actual throughput to be around 80 GB/s (lower than Strix Point), but MBW test is hard...
* The 140V Xe2 GPU on the 258V has Vector Engines with 2048-bit XMX units that Intel specs at 64 INT8 TOPS. Each XMX can do INT8 4096 OPS/clock or FP16 2048 OPS/clock, so that would be a max theoretical 32 FP16 TOPS.

For my testing, I use Llama 2 7B (specifically the q4\_0 quant from \[TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGUF\]) as my standard benchmark (it is well quantified and has max compatibility). All testing was done with very-up-to-date HEAD compiles (`build: ba6f62eb (4008)`) of llama.cpp. The system itself is running [CachyOS](https://cachyos.org/), a performance focused Arch Linux derivative, and it is running the latest 6.12 kernel `6.12.0-rc5-1-mainline` and `linux-firmware-git` and `mesa-git` for the maximum support for Lunar Lake/Xe2.

My system is running at PL 28W (BIOS: performance), with the performance governor, EPP, and EPB.

It turns out there are quite a few ways to run llama.cpp - I skipped the NPU since it's a PITA to setup, but maybe I'll get bored sometime. Here's my results:

|Backend|pp512 t/s|tg128 t/s|t/TFLOP|MBW %|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[CPU](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/)|25.05|11.59|52.74|30.23|

|[IPEX-LLM](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm/blob/main/docs/mddocs/Quickstart/llama_cpp_quickstart.md)|708.15|24.35|22.13|63.51|

* pp is prompt processing (also known as prefill, or input) - this is the speed at which any system prompt, context, previous conversation turns, etc are passed in and is compute bound
* tg is token generation (aka output) - this is the speed at which new tokens are generated and is generally memory bandwidth bound
* I've included a ""t/TFLOP"" compute efficiency metric for each Backend and also a MBW % which just calculates the percentage of the tg vs the theoretical max tg (136.5 GB/s / 3.56GB model size)
* The CPU backend doesn't have native FP16. TFLOPS is calculated based on the maximum FP32 that AVX2 provides for the 4 P-Cores (486.4 GFLOPS) at 3.8GHz (my actual all-core max clock). For those interested on llama.cpp's CPU optimizations, I recommend reading jart's writeup [LLaMA Now Goes Faster on CPUs](https://justine.lol/matmul/)
* For CPU, I use `-t 4`, which uses all 4 of the (non-hyperthreaded) P-cores, which is the most efficient setting. This basically doesn't matter for the rest of the GPU methods.

For SYCL and IPEX-LLM you will need to install the [Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit-download.html). I used version 2025.0.0 for SYCL, but IPEX-LLM's llama.cpp requires 2024.2.1

* Setup docs to [Run llama.cpp with IPEX-LLM on Intel GPU](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm/blob/main/docs/mddocs/Quickstart/llama_cpp_quickstart.md) \- as of testing, the llama.cpp was based off of a 2024-08-22 version

The IPEX-LLM results are much better than all the other Backends, but it's worth noting that despite the docs suggesting otherwise, with the Xe2 Arc 140V GPU atm, it **doesn't** seem to work with k-quants ([related to this error?](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm/issues/11080)). Still, at 35% faster pp and 80% faster tg than SYCL FP16, it's probably worth trying to use this if you can.

# vs Apple M4

I haven't seen any M4 inference numbers, yet, but this chart/discussion [Performance of llama.cpp on Apple Silicon M-series #4167](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions/4167) is a good reference. The M3 Pro (18 CU) has [12.78 FP16 TFLOPS](https://www.cpu-monkey.com/en/igpu-apple_m3_pro_18_core) and at 341.67 t/s pp, that gives a \~26.73 t/TFLOP for Metal performance. The new M4 Pro (20 CU) has an [expected 17.04 TFLOPS](https://www.cpu-monkey.com/en/igpu-apple_m4_pro_20_core) so at the same efficiency you'd expect \~455 t/s for pp. For MBW, we can again run similar back-calculations. The M3 Pro has 150 GB/s MBW and generates 30.74 t/s tg for a 73% MBW efficiency. at 273 GB/s of MBW, we'd expect the M4 Pro to have a ballpark tg of \~56 t/s.

# vs AMD Ryzen AI

The [Radeon 890M](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-890m.c4224) on the top-end Ryzen AI Strix Point chips have 16CUs and a [theoretical 23.76 TFLOPS](https://gpuspecs.com/theoretical-performance-calculator), and with LPDDR5-7500, 120GB/s of MBW. Recently AMD just published an article [Accelerating Llama.cpp Performance in Consumer LLM Applications with AMD Ryzen™ AI 300 Series](https://community.amd.com/t5/ai/accelerating-llama-cpp-performance-in-consumer-llm-applications/ba-p/720311) testing the performance of a Ryzen AI 9 HX 375 with a Intel Core Ultra 7 258V. It mostly focuses on CPU and they similarly note that llama.cpp's Vulkan backend works awfully on the Intel side, so they claim to compare Mistral 7B 0.3 performance w/ IPEX-LLM, however they don't publish any actual performance numbers, just a percentage difference!

Now, I don't have a Strix Point chip, but I do have a 7940HS with a Radeon 780M (16.59 TFLOPS) and dual channel DDR-5600 (89.6 GB/s MBW) so I ran the same benchhmark on a Mistral 7B 0.3 (q4\_0) and did do some ballpark estimates:

|Type|pp512 t/s|tg128 t/s|t/TFLOP|MBW %|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|140V IPEX-LLM|656.5|22.98|20.52|64.48|
|780M ROCm|240.79|18.61|14.51|79.55|
|projected 890M ROCm|*344.76*|*24.92*|14.51|79.55|

I just applied the same efficiency from the 780M results onto the 890M specs to get a projected performance number.

Anyway, I was pretty pleasantly surprised by the IPEX-LLM performance and will be exploring it more as I have time.",2024-11-01 13:16:00,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gheslj/testing_llamacpp_with_intels_xe2_igpu_core_ultra/

An A40 is for faster tokens per second, but I imagine you could get away with much smaller for your own needs.

I have heard that when there are 2 gpus in the system, Ollama will use the VRAM off both, but only use one for the computations. A very optmistic voice inside my head tells me that it will work fine with two completely different gpus belonging to different generations, but rationally I think there might be issues.

1gh9ezo,Are ADA generation cards actually better than Ampere in all use cases?,"So I was having a quick look at the specification differences between the ampere and Ada generation RTX cards and noticed that the ""equivalent"" models over the two generations actually lose memory bandwidth in ADA:

I appreciate the available VRAM and clock speeds are higher, as well as a significant difference in the TFLOPs from the tensor cores, but is this not an unnecessary bottleneck for the kind of work they are designed for? 

I also had a quick look at the RTX 4000 ADA vs the Ampere RTX A5000, on most of the benchmarks, the RXT 4000 ADA is 9% ""better"" than the RTX A5000, but the memory bandwidth is even lower. Couple that with the fact that none of the ADA generation appear to have NVlink, I'm wondering whether there are actually advantages to sticking to ampere cards. The efficiency per watt appears to be drastically better on the Ada generation cards, so I'm wondering whether the main difference is actually aimed at the enterprise running cost metric, rather than actually being a generational leap in raw performance.

With text-to-text models we have a lot of tools available (e.g. guided generation, function calling...), to get other things to happen beyond just a loop of human turn -> LLM turn...

How would we go about building more complicated user experiences with speech-to-speech models?

My first thought is, during the conversation, do STT and parse that text and do something based on it (perhaps including a text-to-text LLM in the pipeline) to get useful things to happen. Maybe the speech-to-speech LLM you're chatting with doesn't need to know about what happened, but if it does, getting that back into the conversation seems tricky. You could, in theory, do TTS and feed that in to the speech-to-speech model, but I'm not sure we have any tooling for that yet. 

Not sure if this is more of a discussion or a question. Perhaps this is a solved problem and I'm just not aware of the solution. I'd love to hear folks thoughts",2024-11-01 06:59:52,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gh62bl/building_with_speechtospeech_models/

I see people do that and pick up on the language decently quickly. So if you give the model a few hundred thousand examples of translations, alongside pairs of symbols to English words, the model will relatively quickly pick up how to convert the hieroglyphs into English fluently right?

Anyways, I read so many articles that now I'm confused as to the ideal model to get for my needs and hardware specs. My hope is that I can find tune the model to get better at these old languages. I have a subscription to Claude and GPT but find they are more suited to modern languages like Python. I'm a complete beginner.

Question 2
Can you direct me to some newbie friendly tutorials on fine tuning? I understand there is different types of fine tuning. Do I even need to find tune,? For example, doesn't Ollama allow you to point to a folder with documents it can use as reference to answering? (Hope that made sense)

In the attached image, I have the attention values for each past token at a specific moment during generation. The next top tokens are:  "" so"" (\~80%), "" which"" (\~13%), "" but"" (\~4%).

I'm interested in boosting the probability of "" but"" by manually (manually for now) increasing attention on specific past tokens, but I haven’t managed to achieve this consistently. For example, I increased the attention on "" yesterday"" (token index 42) and "" currently"" (token index 33) in the latest layer, but this didn’t make "" but"" more probable or not by much.

**Should I also increase attention on other tokens? If so, which ones (e.g., token ""2"")?**

**Or is my understanding flawed, and what I want to achieve isn’t feasible by adjusting attention weights alone?**

I was honestly expecting this to be easier :) and to have more challenges in the next step, where I somehow decide which attention weights to bump in an algorithm, instead of manually choosing the tokens.",2024-10-31 14:30:08,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ggpm6b/adjusting_the_attention_placed_on_past_tokens_to/

1ggomp9,Anyone have tips on improving a text-to-SQL rag? ,"Hey everyone!

I’m working on a text-to-SQL RAG and have hit a bit of a performance bottleneck. Just trying to crowdsource ideas and tips. 

So what I’ve done is created a vector object for each table and within it created keys for the column names, data types, and a brief description of the data each column contains. 

I created a separate vector DB containing business logic (i.e when asked about ‘x’ ensure you do ‘y’) 

Step 1: An LLM is instructed to augment the user query. The LLMs prompt is injected with the users role, and description of the tables they have access to. This is a user object passed into it. It uses that information to try to infer what the user is asking about and then makes the query more verbose with keyword injection. 

Step 2: An asynchronous call is made to both DBs with the augmented user query. The 25 most relevant columns are returned based on cosine similarity and then reranked using a semantic reranker. The top 10 most relevant rules are returned. 

Step 3: An LLM used the user information, the original query, the 10 most relevant columns, and the 10 most relevant business rules to format the query 

Step 4: The query hits the DB. If it fails another LLM reviews the error, analyzes the query, and iterates on it for a retry. 

This has proven to be surprisingly performant but not trustworthy enough for production. Any tips?

**(UPD chart changed to more data points with 105 MHz step and Llama 70B Q8)**

While trying to optimize power draw of 6x3090 LLM inference build - I tried to change max core speed, not power limit.

My belief is that keeping high power limit but limiting the core speed gives different type of control - where all required power is kept for the memory while cores can be maintained at just necessary level.

Interesting thing is a clear t/s plateau after around 1100 MHz, while power draw spikes significantly after 1300.

I am wondering why this happens? Power should go somewhere, but it does not go into t/s.

Anyway, limiting max core clock may seem to be a preferrable method of tuning GPUs for LLM inference.

I would like to hear your thoughts on this and if maybe anyone else already tested clock speed impact specifically.

Test method:

* 6 x 3090, power limit 300W (just for safety, seems not to affect results at all)
* pcie config per card (all 4.0): x8 (cpu), x4 (cpu), x4 (cpu), x4 (cpu), x4 (cpu), x4 (chipset)
* Llama 3.1 70B Q8 exl2 quant
* tabbyAPI with tensor-parallel enabled. Ubuntu 22.04. Nvidia driver v.560
* full restart of tabbyAPI for each measurement
* launched with 32k context, but prompt is just ""write 15 sentences about summer""
* command to set max core speed (e.g 1305MHz) for all gpus is `nvidia-smi -lgc 0,1305`

P.S. Power draw measurement done with wall power meter, minus idle system power, then divided to get single card value.",2024-10-31 10:11:43,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ggjngw/gpu_speed_vs_tokens_per_second_power_draw_test/

1gge5bh,Production-ready and fast RAG Solution for Generating JSONs Based on PDF Documents my quick research result.,"Hey everyone!

I’m exploring options for a production-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setup to generate JSON data from documents. My goal is to get **accurate, commercial-ready outputs** as quickly as possible. I’m open to models, as long as the results are reliable and production-suited. After some research and help from GPT, I’ve narrowed down to a few options and would appreciate insights or any advice based on experience.

# Current Options Considered GPT table:

https://preview.redd.it/azd7m59yg3yd1.png?width=899&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dd00c476aceeef1ddd56aa7ba0a3709c9bcf54a

Key Priorities:

* **Accuracy and production-readiness** for JSON outputs.
* **Commercial use** licensing and support.
* **Ease of scaling and deployment** for enterprise production (though I’m flexible on initial setup time if results are solid).
* I could pay

AWS Bedrock seem like the best path for this, or would something else better fit my needs? Does anyone have experience with Bedrock in a production RAG workflow, or should I be looking deeper into SageMaker or an open-source alternative?

It seems that Haystack would be nice for production, customization and then putting it on the cloud but with a bit more time investment.",2024-10-31 06:10:56,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gge5bh/productionready_and_fast_rag_solution_for/
1gge4xd,Minimum viable LLM,"After having used the 125M MobileLLM released by Meta today and getting actually far more decent and coherent replies than expected I wonder what the absolute minimum size is of an LLM is that can still produce coherent text.

I should probably define what I mean with ""coherent text"".

* Text should be grammatically correct and understandable (English)

* Text should be at least related to whatever the user has replied to it. A greeting should receive a greeting back, A question about a dog should receive an answer back at least related to dogs, even if not factually correct or useful.

What is the absolute lowest we could go with parameters that could still produce these outcomes? I honestly didn't expect we would get coherent models under GPT-2 size which was about ~1.5B 

After experiencing a 125M model that clearly outperforms GPT-2 made me rethink this entirely. How small can we go? 50M? 10M? 1M? 100K?",2024-10-31 06:10:25,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gge4xd/minimum_viable_llm/

1ggdnu6,Train lots of small LLMs and merge them into one large one?,"Maybe that was just a very stupid idea I had a few minutes ago, maybe someone has an argument against it, then the topic is quickly over again.

The problem we have with open models and normal consumer PCs is simply that even a high-end consumer PC can only train tiny LLMs from scratch.

That's why I remembered that some people merged two 7B models into one 11B model, for example, and that worked well.

From this consideration I came up with the following idea:

What if you were to train lots of small 1B (or even smaller) models, each model with a different training dataset, the dataset would be cut in pieces and than with every piece would be a 1B model trained. But of course with the same LLM basis and perhaps also with the same training parameters. These are details that would need to be figured out.

Since they are all small models, they are much easier to train on consumer hardware. Almost anyone with good hardware could train a 1B model, it would just have to be coordinated because of the training material.

Then all the individual 1B models (maybe even 100 of them), which are all based on different training material, are simply merged together. 1B models could even be trained separately by topic, which would allow you to create merges for certain topics/areas (NOT confusing it with MoE) of use, the only question is what the result would be after the merge.

Silly approach? Is merging perhaps the real problem here and you would only get a bad broken model out?

Edit: I don't speak on something like MoE, that is something other.

Edit2: If that would work it would have some advantages:

\- people who are particularly well versed in one area would then take care of creating small 1B models with their high-quality training data, which would then end up in the large model.

\- 1B models could be get updated and then are merged again into the larger model, which would make the larger model more update able. Exchange 1B models with better ones, remove bad ones etc.

\- A lot of people would be able to train a 1B model for a bigger model.

\- Merges could be very different, stronger for different fields, smaller and bigger, like a user need or want it.",2024-10-31 05:47:28,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ggdnu6/train_lots_of_small_llms_and_merge_them_into_one/
1ggddqg,Our results experimenting with different training objectives for an AI evaluator,"\*Reposting as the graph images weren't showing :(

Hey r/LocalLLaMA!

Lots of research has been published around LLM-as-a-judge as it's becoming a popular approach to evaluate cheap + fast.

A pretty cool paper that recently came out was from the[ Salesforce AI Research team](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14664); tldr: they found preference optimisation techniques like DPO and RPO could yield better results than supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone as a training objective for LLM-as-a-judge models. We wanted to test this hypothesis as it it's not yet clear which training objective performs best for aligning eval models...

# Our experiments

We trained a Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct with SFT and compared it to base Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct on core benchmarks to see how SFT fares alone.

We also trained a Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model on two training datasets with

1. Purely SFT
2. DPO
3. RPO (compound loss objective incorporates both SFT and DPO)

and compared their performance against the base model across four core benchmarks.

# Here's a summary of our key findings:

https://preview.redd.it/hb26ikcj63yd1.png?width=1453&format=png&auto=webp&s=0033450de8198cb336ec63b8b0ed0266d7ced570

* SFT (Atla Caprioska 70B) showed improvements on in-distribution tasks whereas quality dropped on out-of-distribution tasks, underperforming base Llama-70B on aggregate metrics

https://preview.redd.it/1uyt3cvk63yd1.png?width=1423&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5219625a30c3d52f465f9fac5e22f056a8a59d1

* DPO performed best on the on PreferenceCollection with 98.89% accuracy
* RPO performed best on RewardBench with 81.96% accuracy
* RPO outperformed both SFT and DPO on UltraFeedback (No CoT), with a score of 0.57
* RPO achieved the highest average Pearson correlation on evaluation scores (0.49), compared to SFT (0.43) and DPO (0.43)

If you want the details, here's our [blog post](https://www.atla-ai.com/post/selecting-a-training-objective-for-an-ai-evaluator) \- with extra information on why we think this works. We're working on scaling this up and seeing how far we can push this thing now :)

# Open questions for you all

1ggd3zw,The problem on Gutenberg training material,"I did a bit of research on Project Gutenberg's free e-books, especially the German ones, because I've always wondered why the smaller models are often so bad in German. But I think this problem also exists with many other languages there. I very quickly noticed a problem that I had already expected there and sometimes I recognize from the texts there exactly this terrible German, which some German smaller LLMs often generate.

Many of the e-books there are from very old books (the reason why they are free), written in a language style and using words that nobody would have used for decades. On top free old e-books didn't mean they are written in a very good language quality anyway. Language has evolved a lot and using this data without processing/filtering it as training material does not make the AI better, but only worse, because language from the last 100+ years is wildly mixed together and the AI naturally cannot separate which language comes from which time, it mix it all together. LLMs have problems understanding the aspect of time anyway.

And here I see a general problem, many LLMs are trained with such stuff. Even text from Reddit is used for AI training, and we all know how poor the text quality is here because it's often just quickly written comments where people don't pay much attention to spelling. I'm a good example of this myself, and the fact that I often just have text translated into English using DeepL, like here, only makes it a little better.

We need better filtered training material especially for smaller models and finetunes.

1gg0ua0,"Anyone building this? ""Not quite a game, not quite a movie.. but a dream""","In a recent interview, Marc Andreesen discussed the idea of a new AI-generated media format that he compared to ""Dreams"". Here's the interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpvhuaD5Kk0&t=1319s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpvhuaD5Kk0&t=1319s)

A summary of how Andreesen describes it: ""I wonder if there's new art form here that's not a game and not a movie, but something in between. It's an experience that's:

1. Totally tailored to the user
2. It never ends
3. Everything is generated on the fly, in a synergistic feedback loop with the user
4. Potentially seeded by a human creative
5. Maybe you're playing it, maybe you're just experiencing it""

So thinking about this, I think the existing product closest to this idea is AI roleplay chatbots, but dreams feel different from chatbots because:

1. In a chatbot, you're doing a lot of work to push the chat forward, whereas in a dream, it feels like interesting stuff is just happening, and it's ""easy""
2. Dreams obviously have visuals, sound, etc. not just text

So my questions:

1. Are there any AI products or projects out there that feel like this idea of ""Dreams""?

2) Once in Firebase Storage, a cloud function transforms this PDF into an image(s)
3) This image gets sent via the cloud function to my Flask (Python) server, where it gets analyzed via Ollama. Ollama returns me JSON analyzis on the image.

The quad channel memory has been pretty great for inference model spillover but I want to run 70b Q4 models where the token speed is better than 2/3 t/s. 
I’m running a single 4090 at the moment. I want to add a second card but neither the mobo nor my case will handle another massive 4090. Technically the mobo could run 2 4090s but there would have to be some kind of magical case reconfiguration or something.

I saw that the Gigabyte AI TOP GPU (a 16GB 4070 Ti Super) is a blower card (vents out the back of the PC) which seems perfect for my needs given that my 4090 takes up so much friggin room. It also has GDDR6X VRAM which is the same kind of memory as my 4090. I’ve seen this AI TOP card as low as $850. Is this card worth it to get my system to 40GB of VRAM?

My work is taking on building a local LLM computer that multiple users will have access too, possibly at the same time, and we are wanting to fit the biggest/best model in it, but still have options for speed. **Since this is a company that cannot send any of its data to an offsite/cloud company, it has to be a local setup.** 

The main purpose would be assisting in coding tasks and documentation, finally getting to python test script automation (taking pseudo-code and utilizing already made functions to produce pytest test functions + unit tests). While we are wanting real use during the work day, we will also have jenkins/kron jobs running at night to do the ""safe"" automation work and check it in the morning. 

All of us are proficient at programming and have research/engineering backgrounds.   


**The ask:**  
We have limited funds for building/buying a system that can produce these results, around $10,000, but want to have future ability to build more or expand this one.   


**The plan currently:**  
Buying dual 4090's for 48GB VRAM (real time use, during the work day) and then CPU with 256GB RAM (overnight/weekend use for longer/slower tasks.  
  
**Brainstorm:** 

* Are there any builds out there that use around the $10,000 budget and can beat out the normal dual 4090's and 256GB RAM? 
* Also, is it correct that dual 4090's can have a split LLM and is faster than an A6000 48GB?

Just finished up running a set of custom evals, using a private test set, on several of the major platform LLMs.

Note - I looked at both explicit refusals (""I cannot help with that request."") and hedged (""I cannot provide specific advice, but..."") responses. Since, IMO, a hedged response is just as bad as a direct refusal.

1gfqzs0,"RAG ""Second Brain"" for Technical Docs with code","Hello all,

I’m building a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system as a ""second brain"" for \~3-4k docs I’ve collected, each with descriptions and code snippets on cloud, OS, and more. Here’s my approach so far:

* **Focus**: Starting with **retrieval** and storage, aiming for quick access to relevant docs.
* **Structure of each document**: Does it make sense to use also LLM API to create a short, standardised abstract of each doc to help with organization and tagging.
* **Storage Options**:  vector DB / relational for metadata?

Questions:

Any tips for structuring docs with code and descriptions for efficient retrieval

Has LLM summarization/tagging worked well for your projects?

Which VectorDB do you recommend?

1gfqpy7,How to convert the newly quantized Llama3.2 models to GGUF format?,"I'm new to this, so apologies if I'm making any incorrect assumptions.

I was following [a tutorial](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions/7927) to convert a QLoRA-quantized Llama 3.2 1B model that I downloaded from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-QLORA_INT4_EO8). The issue I'm facing is that the conversion process requires specifying a quantization level with \`--outtype\`, but since the model is already quantized, I’d like to avoid additional quantization.

Here’s the command I got from the tutorial:

`python llama.cpp/convert-hf-to-gguf.py <folder_name> --outfile <file_name>.gguf --outtype q8_0`

From what I've seen, it seems like Mistral's Nemo model is really strong when it comes to coding tasks. It's been able to generate some super functional code, and even does some pretty clever things like replacing third-party modules with more recent libraries.

But, on the other hand, I think Llama is a better fit for chatbot applications. It's got a way more conversational tone, and is able to adapt to different styles and personalities. I mean, it's not perfect - it can make some mistakes - but overall, I think it's a great choice if you're looking to build a chatbot that feels more human-like.

That being said, I've also heard some great things about Codestral. Apparently, it's another powerful tool for coding tasks, and might even be better than Nemo in some cases.

1gf6um2,Effective labeling strategy,"I found that an iterative approach for labeling and fine-tuning LLMs in SFT problems is very effective. Working at a hedge fund, I trained LLMs to do sentiment analysis on different types of text data.

To do this, I first manually label a few data points. I then fine-tune the model on that data and use that model to predict some unlabeled data. The initial results are not that good, but I can add the correct responses to the labeled data and correct the rest. Then I start over and train the model again.

So the process is:

1. Label some data.
2. Train model.
3. Run inference on unlabeled data.
4. Approve of correct outputs and fix the rest.
5. Start over.

By repeating this process, I can efficiently label large datasets and train high-quality models. I also found the model to be very sensitive to my labeling, so that's why I did not want to outsource it.

1gf5nf2,Best approach for converting podcast videos to vertical format - focusing on active speakers (multiple speakers in frame)?,"Hey everyone!

I've built a workflow that automatically identifies interesting segments from long podcast videos (e.g., picking 3-4 one-minute highlights from a 2-hour episode).

Now I'm tackling the next challenge and honestly struggling to get it working robustly: intelligently cropping these segments to vertical (9:16) or square (1:1) format while keeping focus on the active speaker. I've tried a few approaches but none seem to work reliably, especially with multiple speakers, so I'm looking for suggestions (models, tools, workflows, anything tbh) from folks who've solved this problem.

**Current Situation:**

* Already have a working pipeline for selecting the best segments
* Need to convert these landscape (16:9) highlights to vertical/square
* Videos have multiple speakers (sometimes in same frame)
* Need to automatically track and focus on whoever is speaking

**Where I'm Struggling:**

I tried some things but dint work. I also found this open source repo : [https://github.com/ClipsAI/clipsai](https://github.com/ClipsAI/clipsai), which mostly seems to work but still fails in edge case.

Overall the tools I've tried specifically fail when:

- Two people are in the same frame and one is speaking
- Quick speaker transitions happen
- Need to maintain smooth focus on the active speaker

Current results are janky and unreliable

**What I'm Looking For:**

* Open-source solutions preferred (so I can modify/hack as needed)
* (Or) Pre-trained models that I can plug and play
* Even paid solutions are fine if they work really well
* Performance is priority over speed/cost

**Questions:**

For the folks who have done this kind of thing.

1. What tools/models do you use for this kind of task?
2. How do you handle multiple speakers in the same frame and intelligently identify who is speaking and get the bounding box around them?
3. Any recommendations for robust speaker detection + tracking within the video?

Again, I'm not worried about processing time or cost - just want the best possible results. Would really appreciate hearing from anyone who's tackled this successfully!",2024-10-29 14:11:41,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gf5nf2/best_approach_for_converting_podcast_videos_to/

2. Setting up each as an API for inter-service communication. - never done that

[https://opensource.org/ai/open-source-ai-definition](https://opensource.org/ai/open-source-ai-definition)

What truly defines an ""open source"" AI? According to the Open Source Initiative (OSI), an open-source AI model must provide sufficient details about its design to enable substantial recreation and detailed information about the data, including its sourcing, processing, and licensing.

TLDR;

To be considered open source, an AI system must provide access to:

* **Data information:** Detailed information about the training data, including its provenance, characteristics, labeling methods, and processing techniques. This information should be sufficient for a skilled individual to recreate a similar system.
* **Code:** The complete source code for training, running, and validating the system, including data processing, training procedures, and model architecture.
* **Parameters:** Model parameters like weights and configuration settings.

1geljps,Trio: assign up to 3-Step tasks to your local web-based small language model,"Hi everyone!

I'm currently developing a web-based language model service using a small language model. Given the inference capabilities of this model, my plan is to break down complex tasks into smaller ones and delegate certain tasks to APIs. For example, you can send the generated text to DeepL for translation automatically.

So far, I've achieved very good results in my tests, and I would love to hear your suggestions.

The backbone technologies are WebLLM and Qwen-2.5-1.5B.

This project is completely open source: [https://github.com/sudoghut/trio](https://github.com/sudoghut/trio)

1gekd53,Document understanding is very very hard: an illustration,"**NOTE:** [**Intraluminal**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Intraluminal/) **appears to have solved it 99% right (not quite perfect but close)**

The swimming pools in San Francisco publish their schedule in a [cute little single page flyer](https://sfrecpark.org/DocumentCenter/View/24705/Rossi-Fall1_Sept-20_Nov-14-2?bidId=)**.**

**My challenge to you**: Try and get an open or closed source model to correctly extract the recurring schedule for lap swim periods. Feel free to chain of thought all you want.

**Bonus extra**: Try and get them to generate it in the ical (ics) format, so it can be dropped into your calendar.

**Ultra bonus**: Get the ical / ics file to correctly handle the start / end and holidays

**Maximum power**: Get your prompt to reliably work on on schedules for 2-3 [neighbouring pools](https://sfrecpark.org/482/Swimming-Pools)

Let me signpost a few things that will trip you up:

* Claude & OpenAI typically try to simply extract text from PDFs ... they'll gloriously blow up the structure
   * You pretty much have to just use an image of the PDF instead of the PDF
* Most closed model I've tried will miss ... Mondays
* Even if you specific promptly to remind them of the existance of Mondays ... they'll get the lap swim time on Wednesday hilariously wrong

Impressive things that large models get right:

* There are holidays to watch out for (but they will still miss Mondays)!
* 3 lane lap swim events are different and special!
* When to start and end the schedule

My takeaway ... a six year old can do this task, but our best document understanding infra still cannot. We've got a ways to go!

1gedd2a,Some Lessons Learned from Fine Tuning Embeddings for RAG,"Last year my team worked on a fine tuned open source model, trained on US military doctrine and pubs ([workflow](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/15oome9/our_workflow_for_a_custom_questionanswering_app/) and [follow-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1686ul6/some_lessons_learned_from_building_a_fine_tuned/) posts).  Bottom line is that the fine tuned 7b model worked really well, especially on conceptual questions (like how maneuver and mission command interact): better than GPT-3.5 and about even with GPT-4 based on human ratings from military members.

Been itching to try fine tuning embeddings, and my team finally got a chance.  We ran a series of experiments, but **the big picture takeaway was that our first approach collapsed the embeddings space and made retrieval accuracy plummet, but a second approach using train+eval worked well and substantially improved retrieval**.

We started with our model training data: a context+question column and answer column.  We took the context chunk (500 tokens from a military publication) and the question generated from it, reversed their order and used them as the training data for the embeddings fine-tuning. So basically ""When you see ""What are the principles of air defense in urban areas?"" then retrieve <some chunk about urban defense that has some sentences on air defense principles>.

We used Sentence Transformers and FSDP, because we had to shard the embedding model and data across multiple GPUs. To our distress however, each epoch of training made the model perform worse and worse, until at 5 epochs it was just random retrieval.  Our intuition was that the model was overfitting and collapsing the embedding space until all documents were crammed next to each other.  We used [WizMap](https://github.com/poloclub/wizmap/blob/main/LICENSE) to visualize embedded docs, and sure enough the base model showed clear clusters of docs, 2 epochs showed them kind of crammed closer, and at 5 epochs a giant blob with two camel humps.

We then switched to DDP from FSDP, which allows you to use an evaluator parameter during fine tuning, so we could use the eval data during training, not just post-hoc, something like:

   1. num\_train\_epochs=2,
   2. per\_device\_train\_batch\_size=32,
   3. per\_device\_eval\_batch\_size=32,

1. During training, would train on a batch from the “TRAIN” dataset, and then evaluate on a batch from the “EVAL” dataet
2. Use that train/eval comparison to inform the loss function
3. Train for 2 or 5 epochs
4. Post-training, ran our eval pipeline.

Success!  Using BGE Small w. 384 dimensions, we went from:

* Base model top 20 accuracy of 54.4%.
* 2 epochs fine-tuned model: Top 20 retrieval accuracy  70.8%.
* 5 epochs fine-tuned model: **Top 20 retrieval accuracy 73%.**

We then tried Stella-400M 1024 dimensions:

* Base model top 20 accuracy of 62.9%.
* 2 epochs fine-tuned model (train batch-size 4, gradient accumulation
* steps 20): Top 20 retrieval accuracy was 73.3%.
* 3 epochs fine-tuned model (train batch-size 3, gradient accumulation
* steps 40): Top 20 retrieval accuracy was 72.4%
* Increased batch size (train batch size 8, grad accumulation steps 25) with 2
* epochs fine-tuning on 8 GPU clusters: **Top 20 retrieval accuracy was 74.4%**

It was always my intuition that fine-tuning even a good general embedding model would lead to more domain relevant retrieval, and very cool to empirically demonstrate it in a practical, real world problem space.",2024-10-28 14:13:04,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gedd2a/some_lessons_learned_from_fine_tuning_embeddings/

We have a state machine that has some base states and some basic callback functions that go through an SSH login attack. We are trying to implement a Local LLM that will dynamically give Python callback functions to the state machine to use to attack and defend. We also want the LLM to dynamically expand and pivot the state machine if, say, port 22 isn't open so that it can continue to try and attack the machine even though we don't have states to try different ports and stuff.

Right now, we are stuck in getting the local LLM to provide callback functions to the state machine. It works some of the time, but because the LLM will give back different responses like adding triple quotes around the code sometimes or explaining the code line by line, we are unable to consistently get and use the code from the LLM automatically. Any ideas on how to get consistent code back from the LLM?

Another issue we are having is that we are exporting out the state machine in JSON so that the LLM can see what the current state machine looks like. It's not a huge JSON file, but the LLM is having trouble giving back the whole JSON file with the new states so that we can import it back into the state machine. If anyone has any ideas on this, that would be awesome.

We have recently launched the Model Depot collection, one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of generative AI models pre-packaged in OpenVino and ONNX formats. These models have been quantized, tested and optimized for fast, high-quality inferencing in resource-constrained edge environments, especially on AI PCs, and more generally on x86 architectures.

The collection includes over 100 state of the art open source models including:
- Leading Generative Models — leading generative decoder models from 1B — 14B+ parameters in the following leading open source series: Llama 3.2/3.1/3.0/2, Qwen 2.5/2, Mistral 0.3/0.2/0.1, Phi-3, Gemma-2, Yi 1.5/1.0, StableLM, Tiny Llama and popular and leading fine-tunes including Zephyr, Dolphin, Bling, OpenHermes, Wizard, OpenOrca, Nemo, and Dragon;
- Specialized Models — specialized fine-tuned models in math and programming including: Mathstral, Qwen Code-7B, and CodeGemma;
- Multimodal Models — Qwen2-VL-7B, Qwen2-VL-2B, Llama 3.2 11B vision designed for edge deployment of vision+text -> text models;
- Function-Calling Models — specialized function-calling SLIM models for multi-model, multi-step agent-based workflows; and
- Encoders — embedding models, rerankers, and classifiers.

All of the models are prepackaged in “inference ready” x86 optimized formats, e.g., OpenVino and ONNX, quantized with int4, including applying “smart” quantization ratios to mitigate quality impacts (e.g., keeping some parameters at 8-bit).

The models are all in open source, licensed on permissive terms consistent with the terms of the underlying models, and made available as a resource to the wider community to use in their own deployments.

1ge9192,We just Open Sourced Promptwright: Generate large synthetic datasets using a local LLM,"Hey Folks! 👋

We needed a means to generate large synthetic datasets using a local LLM, and not OpenAI or a paid cloud service. So we built [Promptwright](https://github.com/StacklokLabs/promptwright) - a Python library that lets you generate synthetic datasets using local models via Ollama.

Why we built it:

* We were using OpenAI's API for dataset generation, but the costs were getting expensive for large-scale experiments. 
* We looked at existing solutions like pluto, but they were only capable of running on OpenAI. This project started as a fork of [pluto](https://github.com/redotvideo/pluto), but we soon started to extend and change it so much, it was practically new - still kudos to the redotvideo folks for the idea.
* We wanted something that could run entirely locally and would means no concerns about leaking private information.
* We wanted the flexibility of using any model we needed to.

What it does:

* Runs entirely on your local machine using Ollama (works great with llama2, mistral, etc.)
* Super simple Python interface for dataset generation
* Configurable instructions and system prompts
* Outputs clean JSONL format that's ready for training
* Direct integration with Hugging Face Hub for sharing datasets

We've been using it internally for a few projects, and it's been working great. You can process thousands of samples without worrying about API costs or rate limits. Plus, since everything runs locally, you don't have to worry about sensitive data leaving your environment.

The code is Apache 2 licensed, and we'd love to get feedback from the community. If you're doing any kind of synthetic data generation for ML, give it a try and let us know what you think!

1ge87eg,Running Llama 3.2 1B and 3B (and other SLMs) as in-browser AI assistant for any website ,"Hi everyone!

  
I recently saw a proliferation of Chrome extensions claiming to be private and secure while still sending your data to OpenAI, Claude and other APIs. I guess my concept of ""private"" is different. People use those extensions to rewrite emails and other private messages as well as summarize private documents without understanding what is happening to their data.  
  
So, I created a similar extension but instead of using remote APIs it uses small models embedded directly in your browser. You just select one model from the list, and it get's downloaded to your cache and runs locally, with no external connection. You can indeed use it even offline. You can select text on websites to add it automatically as context, translate it, rewrite it, fix grammar, etc.

It works with just 1.4 GBs of GPU for 1B parameters models and they are surprisingly fast. Currently supports Llama (1B, 3B, 8B), Qwen (0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B), Mistral (7B), Gemma 2 (2B) and SomlLm (7B).   
  
There is also another advantage, no monthly suscription is required because there is no API to pay. I am currently bootstrapping another bigger project focused on running models privately in the browser, so in order to support it, I added a one-time payment, but feel free to send me a DM and I will be happy to issue you a free code.

(Be sure to increase the cache quota of the browser if the model doesn't fit. You will see a clear  download error showing ""cache quota exceeded"" if that happens.)

I would like to present my first open-source vision-based LLM project: WololoGPT, an *AI-based coach* for the game **Age of Empires 2**. 

Video demo on Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXqVKgQRCYs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXqVKgQRCYs)

My roommate always beats my ass at this game so I decided to try to build a tool that watches me play and gives me advice. It works really well, alerts me when resources are low/high, tells me how to counter the enemy. 

The whole thing was coded with Claude 3.5 (old version) + Cursor. It's using Gemini Flash for the vision model. It would be 100% possible to use Pixtral or similar vision models. I do not consider myself a good programmer at all, the fact that I was able to build this tool that fast is amazing.

    >>> How do I bake a loaf of bread?
    To bake a loaf of bread, you'll need to follow these steps:
    
    1. **Preheat**: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) with a baking stone or rim underneath the bread to prevent burning.
    2. **Prepare the dough**: Make sure the dough is at room temperature and has not been stretched, flexed, or baked in excess.
    3. **Cut out shapes**: Use a pastry cutter or sharp knife to cut out circles of dough for each slice of bread. You can also use a round cookie cutter or a rectangular cookie cutter.
    4. **Line up the slices**: Line up the slices of bread on a baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the top.
    5. **Bake in the middle**: Bake for 3-4 minutes, until the edges are lightly golden brown and the center is set.
    6. **Let it cool completely**: Let the dough rest for 10 minutes before cutting out shapes to allow the butter to firm up.
    7. **Cut out the shape(s) with a knife or pastry cutter**: Carefully cut out each shape from the dough, making sure not to press too hard and tear the dough.
    8. **Let it cool completely again (for 3-4 minutes more)**: Let the dough rest for another minute before cutting out the shape again.
    9. **Cut out the final shape(s) with a knife or pastry cutter**: Carefully cut out each shape from the dough, making sure not to press too hard and tear the dough.
    10. **Let it cool completely (again)**: Let the dough rest for another minute before cutting out the final shape again.
    11. **Cut out the final shape(s) with a knife or pastry cutter**: Carefully cut out each shape from the dough, making sure not to press too hard and tear the dough.
    12. **Let it cool completely (again)**: Let the dough rest for another minute before cutting out the final shape again.
    13. **Cut out the final shape(s) with a knife or pastry cutter**: Carefully cut out each shape from the dough, making sure not to press too hard and tear the dough.
    14. **Let it cool completely (again)**: Let the dough rest for another minute before cutting out the final shape again.
    15. **Scoop and serve**: Once all the slices of bread are cut up, scoop them into plates or cups and serve immediately!

1ge044j,LLMs as Judges: How Do Different Models Evaluate Subtle Nuances in Japanese-to-English and English-to-Japanese Translation?,"How much difference can be expected between closed and open models when using LLMs as judges?

In this experiment, we used LLM Comparator to evaluate the Japanese-to-English and English-to-Japanese translations of two 2B models, comparing their scores. The differences were subtle, with many cases where ""the meaning is the same, but Model B uses slightly more polite phrasing than Model A.""

For example, GPT-4o scored these cases as equivalent, while Claude 3.5 Sonnet slightly favored Model B for ""maintaining a commonly accepted level of politeness in Japanese communication.""

Both judgments are valid, and since such subtle differences can easily be adjusted by prompt wording, these results don’t represent an absolute performance difference. Nevertheless, with u/randomfoo2 ’s support, we were able to compare models under the same conditions, even for large-scale models that would normally be difficult to run, which serves as a valuable reference.

At least for now while there is this land grab for users and providers are giving away inference free or maybe at low prices.

But if API pricing increases or decreases substantially, then this could impact local inferencing projects, either causing them to be shelved due to being too expensive, or expanded if API becomes too expensive.

Competition will eventually weed out a few providers, but do you think that longer term API prices will increase (as competition fades and there is less subsidising/customer acquisition) or decrease (technology improves and companies scale)?

1gdv9ku,4x 3090 agent-focused homeserver; build suggestions and software choices,"I am putting together a new homeserver, and I want it to include the hardware for the following use cases:
- inference
- PEFT up to 70B models (Qwen2.5)
- continuously-running agent environments (AutoGen, OpenHands)
- room for increasing GPU count
- data digestion (especially from math-heavy research papers) and synthetic dataset generation

My current build plan is as follows:

- 4x MSI VENTUS 3X 3090 OC - $2k, Takes up 2.5 slots each, but if you pull the plastics and fans off it's just 2. Planning to run an open case anyway, unless I decide to dabble with watercooling.
- MB: ROMED8-2T - $650; Accepts down to 7xx2 EPYCs (128 PCIe lanes), has 7x PCIe 4.0 x16 lanes. Should let me go up to 6x 3090s without having to worry about PCIe bandwidth congestion. Also since it's ATX with 2-unit-spaced x16 lanes, I think I can do 4x 3090 watercooled \*in a case\* if I want a sleek rig.
- CPU: AMD EPYC 7K62 - $300 new on ebay; 48-cores, better value than the 32-cores for $240. While not important for AI, my workload includes general CPU things like data processing, agents compiling code, simple containerized infra.
- RAM: A-Tech (128GB) 8x 16GB 2Rx8 PC4-25600R DDR4 3200 $200- Please check my math but I think it's 25.6Gb/s \* 8 sticks = 204.8Gb/s total memory bandwidth. Is this speed unnecessarily fast? Should I save by going with 2333mhz PC4-17000 \* 8 = 135Gb/s for $130?
- Power: EVGA Supernova 1300W G+ 80% Gold (2 for $150) if I want it - Used from some mining buddies, but I think it's underpowered (math below)

Misc:
- open air case < $50
- probably the LINKUP PCIe risers - 4 x $50
- that one classic brown-fanned $100 CPU cooler,
- Samsung Pro 990 2TB NVMe SSD - maxes out an M.2 4.0 x4 slot at 7.2Gb/s $200
- Extra HDDs for ZFS: Even with 6x 3090s, I still have 8x 4.0 x4 slots open

I'm around $3800 all in, with room to grow on the GPU side.

Other contenders included:
- MZ32 and MZ01 server boards - Nice that you can get them bundled with a 32-core 1st gen EPYC for less than $500, but doesn't really support more than 4 cards without one a card bandwidth bottleneck.
- WRX80 boards - The ASUS one looks gorgeous, and one is on sale for $400 on Amazon, but since I'm going to be occasionally compiling code and other CPU-bottlenecked activities, I think I'm getting a better value with a high-core EPYC compared to the higher single-core performance of the Threadrippers (keeping the $300 price constant, the 12-core Threadripper 3945WX had a 2700 single core and 40k multi score vs the EPYC has 2000 single and 60k multi, rather have 48 cores than 12 I think?)
- Anything with intel sockets - I swore I'd only 80/20 this project from a time perspective and I'm well passed overspending than my time's worth on further optimizing the parts list.

My main questions:

- Will I be able to take advantage of tensor parallelism for inferencing? PCIe 4.0 x16 bandwidth should be 32Gb/s per card, so each card can receive 32Gb/s,  which / 3 cards = 10.6Gb/s from each card. It seems my uses will stay well below this limit. The only benchmarks indicating bandwidth I could find were [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1d8kcc6/psa_multi_gpu_tensor_parallel_require_at_least/) which indicated that for 4x Titan X cards, Aphrodiete/vLLM max one-way PCIe was 5Gb/s.
- If I added cards, will I be able to actually run something like Deepseek2.5 (Q4\_0 is 133GB before context, and 6x 24GB = 144GB VRAM)? I assume it's time I ditch ollama and start playing with MLC-LLM and vLLM.
- Power: Should I plan to underpower the cards in general? I've heard that they can be underpowered from 275-300W all the way down to 200W. Assuming my underpowered spikes are like 300W, then (300W * 4) + (300W CPU 100% load) = 1500W. I assume a single 1300W will not be enough? Will I need 1500 / 80% = ~1850W? What should I calculate fan power in as (assuming a case)?
- Anything I'm not considering or I've overoptimized for?
- What are your favorite self-hosted AI projects? Applications, engines, models, frameworks.

1gdrre2,O1 Replication Journey: A Strategic Progress Report -- Part 1 ,">This paper introduces a pioneering approach to artificial intelligence research, embodied in our O1 Replication Journey. In response to the announcement of OpenAI's groundbreaking O1 model, we embark on a transparent, real-time exploration to replicate its capabilities while reimagining the process of conducting and communicating AI research. Our methodology addresses critical challenges in modern AI research, including the insularity of prolonged team-based projects, delayed information sharing, and the lack of recognition for diverse contributions. By providing comprehensive, real-time documentation of our replication efforts, including both successes and failures, we aim to foster open science, accelerate collective advancement, and lay the groundwork for AI-driven scientific discovery. Our research progress report diverges significantly from traditional research papers, offering continuous updates, full process transparency, and active community engagement throughout the research journey. Technologically, we proposed the journey learning paradigm, which encourages models to learn not just shortcuts, but the complete exploration process, including trial and error, reflection, and backtracking. With only 327 training samples and without any additional tricks, journey learning outperformed conventional supervised learning by over 8\% on the MATH dataset, demonstrating its extremely powerful potential. We believe this to be the most crucial component of O1 technology that we have successfully decoded. We share valuable resources including technical hypotheses and insights, cognitive exploration maps, custom-developed tools, etc at this https URL.",2024-10-27 19:24:04,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gdrre2/o1_replication_journey_a_strategic_progress/

1gdr3al,Pixtral is amazing.,"First off, I know there are other models that perform way better in benchmarks than Pixtral, but Pixtral is so smart both in images and pure txt2txt that it is insane. For the last few days I tried MiniCPM-V-2.6, Llama3.2 11B Vision and Pixtral with a bunch of random images and prompts following those images, and Pixtral has done an amazing job.

\- MiniCPM seems VERY intelligent at vision, but SO dumb in txt2txt (and very censored). So much that generating a description using MiniCPM then giving it to LLama3.2 3B felt more responsive.  
\- LLama3.2 11B is very good at txt2txt, but really bad at vision. It almost always doesn't see an important detail in a image or describes things wrong (like when it wouldn't stop describing a jeans as a *""light blue bikini bottom""*)  
\- Pixtral is the best of both worlds! It has very good vision (for me basically on par with MiniCPM) and has amazing txt2txt (also, very lightly censored). It basically has the intelligence and creativity of Nemo combined with the amazing vision of MiniCPM.

In the future I will try Qwen2VL-7B too, but I think it will be VERY heavily censored.",2024-10-27 18:48:27,199,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gdr3al/pixtral_is_amazing/

1gdqlw7,I tested what small LLMs (1B/3B) can actually do with local RAG - Here's what I learned,"Hey r/LocalLLaMA 👋！

Been seeing a lot of discussions about small LLMs lately ([this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gbwvqg/does_anyone_even_use_the_1b_or_3b_32_llama) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g3pkc2/besides_coding_and_chatting_how_do_you_use_llms/)). I was curious about what these smaller models could actually handle, especially for local RAG, since lots of us want to chat with documents without uploading them to Claude or OpenAI.

I spent some time building and testing a local RAG setup on my MacBook Pro (M1 Pro). Here's what I found out:

# The Basic Setup

* Nomic's embedding model
* Llama3.2 3B instruct
* Langchain RAG workflow
* Nexa SDK Embedding & Inference
* Chroma DB
* [Code & all the tech stack on GitHub if you want to try it](https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk/tree/main/examples/Chat-with-PDF-locally)

# The Good Stuff

Honestly? Basic Q&A works better than I expected. I tested it with Nvidia's Q2 2025 financial report (9 pages of dense financial stuff):

[Asking two questions in a single query - Claude vs. Local RAG System](https://i.redd.it/z9mmi51fcexd1.gif)

* PDF loading is crazy fast (under 2 seconds)
* Simple info retrieval is slightly faster than Claude 3.5 Sonnet (didn't expect that)
* It handles combining info from different parts of the same document pretty well

If you're asking straightforward questions like ""What's NVIDIA's total revenue?"" - it works great. Think of it like Ctrl/Command+F on steroids.

# Where It Struggles

No surprises here - the smaller models (Llama3.2 3B in this case) start to break down with complex stuff. Ask it to compare year-over-year growth between different segments and explain the trends? Yeah... it start outputting nonsense.

# Using LoRA for Pushing the Limit of Small Models

Making a search-optimized fine-tuning or LoRA takes lots of time. So as a proof of concept, I trained specific adapters for generating pie charts and column charts. Think of it like giving the model different ""hats"" to wear for different tasks 🎩.

For handling when to do what, I'm using [Octopus\_v2 action model](https://huggingface.co/NexaAIDev/Octopus-v2) as a task router. It's pretty simple:

* When it sees `<pdf>` or `<document>` tags → triggers RAG for document search
* When it sees ""column chart"" or ""pie chart"" → switches to the visualization LoRA
* For regular chat → uses base model

And surprisingly, it works! For example:

1. Ask about revenue numbers from the PDF → gets the data via RAG
2. Say ""make a pie chart"" → switches to visualization mode and uses the previous data to generate the chart

[Generate column chart from previous data, my GPU is working hard](https://i.redd.it/ywhb69z29exd1.gif)

[Generate pie chart from previous data, plz blame Llama3.2 for the wrong title](https://i.redd.it/d0fq2da79exd1.gif)

The LoRAs are pretty basic (trained on small batches of data) and far from robust, but it hints at something interesting: you could potentially have one small base model (3B) with different LoRA ""plugins"" for specific tasks in a local RAG system. Again, it is kind of like having a lightweight model that can wear different hats or shoes when needed.

# Want to Try It?

I've open-sourced everything, [here is the link again](https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk/tree/main/examples/Chat-with-PDF-locally). Few things to know:

* Use `<pdf>` tag to trigger RAG
* Say ""column chart"" or ""pie chart"" for visualizations
* Needs about 10GB RAM

# What's Next

Working on:

1. Getting it to understand images/graphs in documents
2. Making the LoRA switching more efficient (just one parent model)
3. Teaching it to break down complex questions better with multi-step reasoning or simple CoT

# Some Questions for You All

* What do you think about this LoRA approach vs just using bigger models?
* What will be your use cases for local RAG?
* What specialized capabilities would actually be useful for your documents?",2024-10-27 18:22:28,714,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gdqlw7/i_tested_what_small_llms_1b3b_can_actually_do/
1gdpzow,6x3090 PSU Vibe Check,"I was running

* AMD Threadripper 7965WX
* Asus WS Pro WRX90E-SAGE SE
* 4x 3090 (Two entry level Gigabytes, two EVGA FTW3 Ultra)

on an HX1500i (black label, pre-ATX 3.0 cert) and an HX1000i (blue label). This seemed to work pretty well for me since April. Inference would only load roughly one GPU at a time, though, until tensor parallelism was merged in Oobabooga at the end of last month.

I recently (last week) 

* added a 3090 FE
* added a 3090 Ti FE
* replaced the HX1000i with an ATX 3.0 HX1500i
* power-limited the 3090s (not the Ti) to 300W. 3090 Ti was left alone at 450W.

The original HX1500i died last night during inference. Tensor parallelism was on.

Should 2xHX1500i be enough for this build? Should I be running 3xHX1500i, or something else altogether? Curious as to your thoughts. I did a search before posting, and I've seen everything from people running 4x3090 on a single 1500W PSU; to someone on level1techs who was trying to run 6x3090 on 4650W spread across 5 PSUs, all different; to people ""knew a guy"" or take a leap of faith on ebay and ended up with a monster server PSU.

This is a TL;DR of a longer post I made on the topic on [Level1Techs](https://forum.level1techs.com/t/killed-a-psu-with-my-6x3090-threadripper-build-fluke-or-systemic/219090).

The LLMs themselves will be deployed using vLLM, but I need recommendations for the middleware layer to handle user management and API gateway functionality.

I'm currently considering:

1. [Kong API Gateway](https://github.com/Kong/kong)

2. [KubeAI](https://www.kubeai.org/)

I’m excited to introduce the **Visual Tagger**, a JavaScript tool that serves as the foundation for an extension designed to help multimodal LLMs interact and automate tasks on web pages! This tool highlights HTML elements, displaying their tags, IDs, and classes in visual labels.

LLMs that can analyze images use this information to identify how to access each element (button, input, link, etc.) and can generate JavaScript code to interact effectively with them.

**We now offer a Chrome Extension version of the Visual Tagger!** This extension makes it even easier to inject the Visual Tagger into web pages with just one click.

[Visual Tagger on Google page](https://preview.redd.it/ap9jtw4aqexd1.png?width=1811&format=png&auto=webp&s=07de9e24fee218fe51d211060cb77fa40e4720b0)

**Loading the Extension in Chrome:**

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` in your Chrome browser.
3. Enable Developer mode (toggle found in the upper-right corner).
4. Click ""Load unpacked"" and select the folder containing the extension files.
5. The Visual Tagger icon will appear in your extensions bar, ready to inject the visual tagging.
6. Now, simply click the icon to toggle the Visual Tagger on any page!

The code is still experimental and may miss some elements. **Contributions are welcome!**

I am exploring if I can use a vision language model like Qwen, or Phi for doing similar analytics so things like suspicious activity detection and so forth. 

Right now when I ask Qwen 7B to “analyze the image” from a CCTV camera and tell me what’s going on (I’ve used a LOT of prompts) it frequently gives me uninteresting details in the image like the road is wet, the image appears to be outdoors etc. whereas I’m looking for something like “here’s a person in red Mercedes with black cap with a Reebok tee” — something that I, as a security administrator, may be interested in. Negative prompts also don’t really work. 

Sometimes it does it me the things I’m looking for but 7/10 times it’s off. I’m considering options like LoRA, QLoRa etc. 

I have the following questions: 
1. What would be the best vision language model suited for this use case?

1gd6eg4,How's macs support for LLM / Image models,"I've been a Mac user for almost a decade now, I own an Intel macbook. And my company let me take an M1 macbook home for work.

Last year I bought a gaming laptop and started to try out any new AI models that got released. 

The laptop only got 4080 mobile with 12GB VRAM. It's a great gaming machine, I'm not a huge gamer so i think that should last me for quite a while.

But for AI, it's just OK. And I don't see any trend in consumer GPUs having more VRAM in an affordable price. I've been thinking about getting a mac with 96GB or 128GB ram in the future. For AI and my normal day to day use. 

 I'm still skeptical. I've been seeing mixed messages online. Speed tests generally say it's slower than 4090, but you can run much bigger models without slowing down too much.

But on the other hand, when Flux came out, i think performance was horrible on Mac. I don't know if it's still true. But waiting months for 3rd party support would ruin the fun of AI.

1gd1lm8,Disappointing Gemini 2?,"The Verge is echoing rumors that Demis Hassabis has found ""disappointing"" the performance of Gemini 2.  This raises interesting issues, IMHO.

First and foremost, are we reaching a ceiling in the so called ""scaling law"" applied to transformer based LLMs according to which, new emerging capabilities will occur just because of the compute amount devoted to the models? If so, then the 4 Billion USD investment from Musk's xAI to train Grok 3, might prove fruitless... That we shall see around the end of this year.

Then, it would validate Yann Lecun's point that LLMs are a dead end to true AGI, hence dwarfing the assumption that AGI shall be here around 2027, just by the combined effect of scaling up the current frontier models.

Also, DeepMind has been at the forefront in combining reinforcement learning with deep learning, the hope being that, sometime a tipping point would be reached where self improvement will kick off. Hassabis disappointment might be just an observation that this tipping point is not yet reached with Gemini 2.

Also the drain on OpenAI's talents makes me believe that OpenAI's advantage is quickly eroding, yet if Gemini 2 is indeed disappointing, Sam Altman might still have some elbow room and might delay further the general availability of ""Orion"".

Finally, everybody is eagerly waiting for what Ilya Sutskever will be able to achieve in his own company regarding ASI.  I have no clue, but big hopes, maybe like some of  you in his thaumaturgic powers, LOL.

What are your thoughts on the potential limits of scaling laws? Do you think we’re nearing a dead end with current LLM architectures?",2024-10-26 19:58:38,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gd1lm8/disappointing_gemini_2/

1gcyrtu,What would be the best way to port a python program written with openAI API to localLLMs?,"I found an interesting open-source project that requires the OpenAI API to run, meaning it needs a paid API key. I’d like to port it to work with local LLMs, but it involves modifying some code—like replacing a dropdown for OpenAI model selection and adjusting API calls.

I’ve researched a few solutions:

Ollama-python: Easy to use, but I’ve seen concerns in the community today about its API adding unnecessary complexity as said in the top post here today.
> ""I'm super annoyed by Ollama having their own API on top of an OpenAI-compatible API. This makes some projects only work with Ollama unnecessarily, even though other runtimes would work just fine.""


llamanet: This only required a single-line change to port the code to local LLMs but I couldn't get it to work on the first attempt. The project might not be so mature.


However, I noticed most local inference setups are a bit cumbersome—requiring users to install dependencies (like Ollama), download models, and run them before everything works.



What’s the best way to port open-source projects to local LLMs without making them complicated for end-users?

I started in Windows. In Visual Studio Code I implemented simple script (based on the official example from huggingface). I realized that it uses all VRAM of my 3090 so I decreased max\_pixels and finally everything was OK, VRAM was not fully used and I received great answers to questions related to my images.

However, it was incredible slow. I tested Qwen-VL-7B and Qwen-VL-2B in both cases it took more than 30 seconds to process single image/prompt.

Please notice I confirmed GPU was used by checking VRAM usage in Windows during my script execution.

Then I rebooted into Linux. I copied my script into Visual Studio Code in Linux and was able to execute it. Same prompt, same image, same model files (I used ""HF\_HOME"" variable). 

Generation speed is 4x faster. On both models.

Is there some difference in libs/packages between Linux and Windows? But 4x?

In llama.cpp speed is similar for normal models, I can't use Qwen2-VL in llama.cpp so I used Python instead.

I have the following use case. I have a text file which is the result of parsing HTML and removing unnecessary content; this file is about 4k tokens.

Using ChatGPT & Claude I can provide this file and a prompt that says:

    Extract the following information from the provided content:
        - Name of the calculator that was sold
        - Date on which the auction ended
        - Sale price of the item
        - Delivery costs
    
        Note:
        - Some of the html content can be in German
        - The content concerns a Swiss auction website
    
        Format of the answer:
        - The response should be a line in csv format.
        - Reply ONLY with the csv line, nothing else.
        - Provide only the model name alone (eg HP-67, HP-48, etc.)
        - For HP calculators, there should be a hyphen between HP and the number (eg HP-15C)
        - Example formatting: <calculator model>,yyyy-mm-dd,price

And I get exactly one line with the correct information. However when I use ollama with different models (llama3.1:8b, gemma:9b), it always spits out a longer text, that although related to the content of the file, is not what I'm asking for at all.

Is this too complicated of a task for an 8b model? Is there something I should do differently? When using ollama, I add the text content to the end of the prompt.

1gcnfy5,Techniques to avoid LLM replying to itself?,"I'm trying to create more natural conversation flows where one person may send multiple messages in a row.

It's not surprising, but a ton of models are trained so heavily on conversations where each person writes 1 message and it is strictly back and forth that they can't comprehend the flow if someone writes two messages in a row. 

User: Cats are better than dogs.

Assistant: What? No, dogs are the best!

Assistant: I knew you were a dog person!

(Note how the second sequential assistant reply in this example is nonsensical, as it is treating its own previous message as another person.)

The problem happens whether the conversation is presented as text similar to how it's written as above, or using the special user/assistant token syntax and prompting the assistant to respond twice in a row.

It does seem to help some to inject a prompt to emphasize that the LLM should pay careful attention to who said each line, but it only cuts down the problem maybe 50%. 

It is possible to refactor the chat history behind the scenes and combine any sequence of replies into a single long message that the LLM is extending. That kind of works, but it has two problems. It loses the time element, that the assistant's second message may be after some time has passed, which changes the context and what would make sense to say. Also, there is another limitation that many models are trained to produce replies of a particular length, so if you fake it into thinking it's extending a single long message it will lock on producing the end tokens and ""refuse"" to do any extension.

Anyone have any tips or techniques for dealing with this?",2024-10-26 08:21:40,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gcnfy5/techniques_to_avoid_llm_replying_to_itself/

While the motherboard manual suggests that there is a ATX 24-pin to 4-pin adapter cable bundled with the motherboard, 12VCON\[1-6\] connectors are also non-standard (they call this connector Micro-hi 8-pin), so this is something to watch out for if you intend to use GENOA2D24G-2L+ in your build.

Hi everyone! I'm a machine learning beginner looking to fine-tune the llamada-3.2-3B model using my WhatsApp chat history. My goal is to have the model learn my conversation style. I'm facing some challenges and would greatly appreciate the community's help.

## My Challenge

1. While I know WhatsApp can export chat history, I'm unsure how to convert it into a format that the model can accept for training.
2. I've read the llamada-3.2-3B documentation, but I'm still confused about the data preprocessing requirements.

## What I Know So Far

* WhatsApp can export conversations in .txt format
* llamada-3.2-3B is an open-source conversational model
* The data probably needs to be in a specific format (instruction-following format?)

## Specific Questions

1. How should each conversation be structured as a training sample?
2. Are there any existing data processing scripts I could reference?

If anyone has attempted something similar or is familiar with LLM fine-tuning, I would really appreciate your guidance.

The chat history is in a JSONL file with such record:

Hi guys i have 24 gb vram gpu nvidia gtx 4090 with integrated 64 gb intel gpu. 

When i am running downloaded llama 3.1 8B model on linux system for fine tuning with my instruct dataset. I am getting an error cuda out of memory. Earlier i was getting the error for float32 and then m for float16 also. 

Don't  want it quantized for 4 or 8 bit. So, to run it I tried 128gb gpu also. Again the same problem cuda out of memory.

Should i use vlm? Any code documentation available for funing tuning without peft/lora as i have enough computational memory. I think i need to do cuda semantics. ",2024-10-26 05:26:23,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gcjxcb/cuda_out_of_memory_for_fine_tuning_downloaded/

All the big models handle this well, so I don't know if it's a limitation of small models or if I can tweak my prompt to get it to work consistently on small models. I have tried dozens of variations.

Basically, the user provides a simple text command like ""Save this file as 'text.txt'"" or ""Go to the website wikipedia"". I want the LLM to categorize that command as save\_file, update\_file, navigate\_website, open\_file or not\_found if it can't decide based on the choices given. For any command that fits one of those, it works great. But every time for ""Delete that file"" or other non-listed examples, I get some random hit like 'open\_file'. Any ideas? This should be so trivial. It's driving me nuts.

Prompt: Given the options \[save file, update file, navigate website, open file, not found\], select the option that most accurately matches the intent of the user command.

1gcasik,"A glimpse of the New Claude 3.5-Sonnet ""Computer use"" on a 1-D binary ""screen"":  it excels at counting","One of the core skills that enables Claude 3.5 Sonnet ""Computer use"" is the *accurate counting of pixels* to identify clickable elements in a screenshot, to know where to click. In fact in [Anthropic's blog](https://www.anthropic.com/news/developing-computer-use) on this, they say:

>Claude looks at screenshots of what’s visible to the user, then **counts how many pixels vertically or horizontally it needs to move a cursor** in order to click in the correct place. Training Claude to count pixels accurately was critical. Without this skill, the model finds it difficult to give mouse commands—similar to how models often struggle with simple-seeming questions like “how many A’s in the word ‘banana’?”.

So to get a glimpse of this counting ability I wanted to reduce this to the simplest possible counting scenario, and set up an LLM-Agent to play a **1-Dimensional Bit-Shooter game,** where the goal is to get rid of 1-bits in a bit-string. At each turn,

* the agent (LLM) is given a 1-d bit representation of the current screen state, as a string of bits, e.g. `00100100001`
* the agent uses a ClickTool to specify the bit-index (zero-based) where it wants to click: clicking a bit flips it. E.g.  in this screen if it clicks at position 2, the new screen would be `00000100001`

The LLM is instructed to only click on the  leftmost 1 bit at any given time. The game continues until there are no more 1s left.

Clearly the Agent (LLM) needs to be able to accurately count the bit positions, to be able to correctly click on the 1s. Of course it will make mistakes, and thus may take longer to finish the game.

Here is how I set up this simple experiment using [Langroid](https://github.com/langroid/langroid) here:

[https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/examples/basic/1d-screen-click.py](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/examples/basic/1d-screen-click.py)

This can be run like this:

`python3 examples/basic/1d-screen-click.py --model litellm/anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`

To try other LLMs you can use a different `model` arg, e.g. `gpt-4` or `litellm/anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`

Some observations/notes:

Claude-3.5-Sonnet is clearly superior in accuracy compared to GPT4o and GPT4; The newest Sonnet (20241022 checkpoint) seems noticeably better than the previous one (20240620), though this is only anecdoctal as I haven't done extensive experiments. For example on a 60-bit string with 1s at positions 2, 10, 18, 36, GPT4 gets off to a bad start, correctly flipping position 2, and then constantly flipping the same bit position 9 (see first screenshot).

[1-dimensional Bit-shooter, GPT-4](https://preview.redd.it/dax8ba6gc0xd1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=023ed98004bffbac3137c2d7e771b511e868060b)

Now with claude-3.5-sonnet-20240620: stumbles at first but recovers, unlike GPT-4 --

But the latest (""new"") Claude-sonnet-3.5-20241022 gets it right every time:

[1-dimensional Bit Shooter, Claude-3.5-Sonnet-20241022](https://preview.redd.it/8x11b0l6d0xd1.png?width=2546&format=png&auto=webp&s=3adbd674bf5025173109e3ad1e0ee906c97b6076)

Of course, counting pixels in a screenshot isn't the same as counting bit-indices in a string, but I won't be surpised that some of pixel-counting ability carries over to counting over strings.

Even the latest Claude-3.5-sonnet is not perfect, consistent with what Anthropic says in the blog:

>On one evaluation created to test developers’ attempts to have models use computers, [OSWorld](https://os-world.github.io/), Claude currently gets 14.9%.

1gc76de,Which model is the best for pattern recognition?,"I'm looking for a sub-96GB LLM that is great for pattern recognition. 

My gut feeling is telling me it's either:

1) Qwen 2.5

2) Mistral Large 2407

3) The newest version of Command R +

If anyone has a slightly definitive answer to this, I'd appreciate it. I need an LLM that can analyze a 1 gig dataset to find hidden insights. 

I'm in the early design phases of this idea....and was thinking of having a smaller LLM review the analysis of the bigger LLM and if both models agree then the smaller model would initiate condition ""z."" Everything would run as a Linux service and inference/data analyzation (of ~1 gig of data) would be performed once every 30 days. No clue on the context length. 

My main concern is that today's open-source LLMs cannot reliably perform deep pattern analysis. 

This is not mission-critical stuff....so if the LLM screws up, no money will be lost and nobody will be hurt (except my patience...which is very thin at times with LLMs). 

Thanks if you have any thoughts you can offer. And yes, I realize this is a high-level thread and I really haven't given any super concrete details (intentionally). 

And for the 1GB Data Problem:

Cannot feed it to the LLM all at once. Need to:

1. Pre-process with code
2. Chunk data intelligently
3. Feed summarized data to LLM


Does all of this sound plausible and realistic? I'm using Mistral Large 2407 to help me ideate, and it suggests that I use Python code in the API to guide the LLM. I'm no expert, but that's setting off a bunch of red flags in my mind. What it's proposing sounds like a clusterfuck of happy sunshine rainbow ideas that will inevitably turn into a coding bird's nest that will be hard to isolate what is causing things to break down or not work.",2024-10-25 15:59:10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gc76de/which_model_is_the_best_for_pattern_recognition/

1gc6264,Paper: Why Does the Effective Context Length of LLMs Fall Short?,"Link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18745](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18745)  
Abstract:  
\`\`\`  
Advancements in distributed training and efficient attention mechanisms have significantly expanded the context window sizes of large language models (LLMs). However, recent work reveals that the effective context lengths of open-source LLMs often fall short, typically not exceeding half of their training lengths. In this work, we attribute this limitation to the left-skewed frequency distribution of relative positions formed in LLMs pretraining and post-training stages, which impedes their ability to effectively gather distant information. To address this challenge, we introduce ShifTed Rotray position embeddING (StRing). StRing shifts well-trained positions to overwrite the original ineffective positions during inference, enhancing performance within their existing training lengths. Experimental results show that without additional training, StRing dramatically improves the performance of the latest large-scale models, such as Llama3.1 70B and Qwen2 72B, by over 10 points on popular long-context benchmarks RULER and InfiniteBench, establishing new state-of-the-art results for open-source LLMs. Compared to commercial models, Llama 3.1 70B with StRing even achieves better performance than GPT-4-128K and clearly surpasses Claude 2 and Kimi-chat.  
\`\`\`

Conclusion:  
\`\`\`  
This work uncovers the limitations of current open-source large language models in effectively utilizing their extended training context windows. We show that using positions at the tail of the left-skewed position frequency distributions strongly hinders models’ long-range dependency modeling ability. We introduce StRing, a novel approach that shifts well-trained positions to replace ineffective ones during inference, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to capture distant contextual information without requiring additional training. Our experiments demonstrate that StRing significantly boosts the performance of strong baselines like Llama 3.1 70B and Qwen-2 72B on prominent long-context benchmarks, setting new state-of-the-art results for open-source LLMs.

1gc5ol8,Best LLM Models and Prompts for Novel Writing,"I've been experimenting with using Large Language Models (LLMs) as novel writing assistants, and I'd love to get input from others who have explored this area. My focus has been on five main tasks: brainstorming, expansion, revision, insertion, and continuation. I'm trying to develop a comprehensive prompt template with placeholders for specific editing instructions and novel drafts.



I've encountered several challenges, particularly with revision and continuation tasks:



For revision tasks:

\- I use \`<revision>\` tags to mark sections for editing, but the results have been inconsistent. Common issues include:

1. Poor flow with surrounding context

2. Inappropriate inclusion of information from other paragraphs

3. Revising unintended sections

4. Ignoring closing tags and continuing beyond marked sections

5. Producing results too similar to the original text

6. Generating overly brief responses

7. Lacking sufficient detail

Even with specific guidelines for each issue (e.g., ""ensure smooth transitions with surrounding text""), the results remain suboptimal.



For continuation tasks, I face two main challenges:

1. Rushed scene development with brief responses

2. Predictable storylines - when provided with examples, the model tends to copy rather than innovate



Regarding models, I've tested:

\- Various 123B models at 5bpw exl2

\- Several 70B models (including qwen-2.5) at 4bpw



My observations:

\- 123B models generally understand and follow prompts better than 70B models

\- The official Mistral 123B model shows the best prompt comprehension but tends to generate overly positive narratives lacking tension and conflict

\- Other 123B models create more dynamic stories but show lower prompt adherence and general intelligence compared to the official model

1gc3z64,Best working model for a 3090 3060 combo?,"So I upgraded to a 3090 a while ago and it has been great for Stable Diffusion. I upgraded from a 3060 12gb, and it has taken me an embarrassingly long amount of time to realise I could put the old card in the second PCIe slot, and gain a total of 36gb of Vram!


This is a bit of an unusual setup I guess, so there isn't much talk about it online. What is the best way to optimise this system and what are the best LLM models I could run?
I've currently been running Llama 3.1 70b Q5 GGUF, with a 7950X and 64gb of ram, but having 1.4t/s is killing me with boredom!


I'd like something that fits entirely on the gpus for that sweet speed, and wonder what the best I can do is? I often use about 20000 words of context but less is fine.


Are there any other tips and tricks to help things? I'm currently using LMStudio, and my displays are plugged into the 3090.


I mostly use LLMs to help me write emails and do some creative writing. Looking for something that is close as possible to the current Llama Q5 model in term of quality.

We only need text-to-text, no need for multimodal models.

  
One of the options is splitting the workload between CPU & RAM, and the GPU, but I'm worried that it will provide slower inference speeds, and one of the requirements is a real-time output from the model as well as serving multiple prompts at once.

1gbvl8x,"With LynxHub 1.3.1, Effortless Custom WebUI Publishing & Advanced Installation Control","# 🚀 Exciting Update for [LynxHub](https://github.com/KindaBrazy/LynxHub)

Hey everyone! I’m excited to share the newest **LynxHub** update, a platform I've built to streamline managing and installing WebUIs, and now, anyone can publish and customize their own modules for WebUIs. With **LynxHub v1.3.1**, configuring, optimizing, and managing WebUI setups just got a major upgrade! Whether you’re running specialized GPU configurations or just looking to maximize WebUI performance with ease, this release has something for you.

# 🌟 The Major Change in 1.3.1

**The Stepper System**:

1. **Installation**: With advanced WebUI installer, you can do it all, download files, execute terminal commands, clone repositories, gather user inputs, customize Node.js scripts, and more.
2. **Configuration (PostInstall)**: After installation, LynxHub lets you auto-configure extensions, add custom arguments, and even set up pre-launch actions like opening specific files or folders.

# 🎯 Why This Matters

**Example: Optimized Performance for Any Hardware**  
Say you’re running a GPU-specific setup (e.g., AMD 6700XT). With traditional WebUIs, finding the right configuration can be tricky. LynxHub simplifies this by allowing you to create or install a module optimized for specific hardware. With **ROCm support**, **Zluda arguments**, and other fine-tuned settings for your GPU, you can get the best possible performance out of your setup.

Want to automatically install commonly used extensions like ControlNet? It’s as simple as adding a single line to your module:

    stepper.postInstall.installExtensions(['https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet'], targetDirectory);

LynxHub displays real-time progress and handles it all, making setup as easy as a single click. No more hunting down settings!

**Beyond GPUs—Flexible Use for Any Setup**  
It's not just for GPUs. For instance, you can create a module that installs **ComfyUI** with pre-configured nodes, extensions like comfyui-manager, and any needed presets. This ensures that users get a perfectly optimized WebUI setup with minimal effort.

**Customizable for Any Installed WebUI**  
Already have a WebUI installed? LynxHub makes it easy to apply new configurations or PostInstall options to existing WebUIs, letting you update and enhance setups without reinstalling from scratch.

I need to split txt files containing threads of emails into isolated emails or preserving the metadata (sender, receiver(s), subject, date).

Currently, I achieve this using regular expressions, but it's not very flexible, and prone to failure because the structure in the threads vary wildly. If I get emails where the metadata is in a language I hadn't anticipated, it fails. I've also tried using the built in python libs for splitting emails, but it doesn't work in practice. 
I'd like a more robust approach, and training a small LLM came to mind.

1gbmkl5,Can LLMs Understand? - Understanding Understanding,"Can AIs truly understand? The question is hotly debated, and has been something we have wondered about since the times of the Chinese room and before. Will a machine ever truly know, even if it can repeat facts? I believe that we must first clearly define what we mean by understand, before we can have meaningful discussion on the topic.  
  
I would like to propose here a simple definition of understanding. It is pragmatic, and sidesteps the issues of subjectivity that lead us down rabbit holes of circular argumentation. Let us speak functionally of what understanding is.

Understanding is the product of learning.  
  
I think that this is a concise and sufficient definition, even if it isn’t fully complete. Understanding is what you obtain from learning. It is distinct from memorization, which is simply storing data. Understanding allows you to apply learned patterns to new situations and generate novel information.  
  
Here is an example of the distinctions I am trying to draw. You can memorize 100 digits of Pi, but without learning that Pi = C/D, you will never know the 101st digit. Understanding this, you can now use the pattern that you have learned to generate additional data.  
  
Now let’s apply this to machines. You can enter data into a database, and we don’t call this machine learning. It is data entry, information storage, analogous to memorization. But if you train a neural network, it extracts patterns from the data and is able to generate new data based on the patterns. This is distinct from information storage or memorization, the patterns are learned and “understood.”  
  
Let's address some common objections.  
  
“LLMs don’t understand, they memorize and repeat.” - This is not what LLMs do. They generate novel data, they are not simple recitation engines. Databases and compression algorithms accomplish this task far more efficiently, and they create no new output.  
  
“The formula for Pi can be programmed into computers, does my calculator demonstrate understanding?” - No, the machine did not learn the formula, it did not extract the pattern from data, it is following a rule that was programmed into it. Nothing was learned, nothing is understood, it simply repeats operations that were pre-defined by a human.  
  
“LLMs don’t understand, they are just predicting the next token based on statistics.” - This is a non sequitur. Next token statistical prediction is the mechanism of action, much like neuronal activation is the mechanism of action for a human mind. This reductive description does not invalidate the argument.  
  
“LLMs have no conscious subjective experience, this is required for understanding.” - I would argue that the conscious experience of understanding and the phenomenon of understanding itself are two distinct things. Arguments about the theoretical subjective states of other entities are arguments about something that can never be known, I find this line of discussion to be unproductive.

They excel in short passages and can do RP fairly well but when it comes to actual novel writing they very quickly lose coherency. We've come far since GPT-3.5 came out almost 2 years ago but I can't help feeling like the progress we've made in term of the ability to write long stories well has not advanced much, compared to the progress made in reasoning, for exemple. 

I understand that the very nature of LLM and the way they are trained make the sort of thing I am asking about difficult. I had hoped that a model like o1, who represented a breakthrough in reasoning would also represent a significant increase in writing ability. As the benchmarks have shown, as well as my personal use of o1-preview, it was not the case.

It's basically a PCIe 4.0x16 switch. Eg. 1x PCIe 4.0x16 in and 2x PCIe 4.0x16 out. A true PCIe switch so no bifurcation or anything needed! It contains a Microchip PM40052 chipset. CRAZY for 60 bucks!

It totally works on my desktop computer when connected with a riser cable.

But that is not the point.... The point is to connect this all to a thunderbolt controller! Eg to build a 19"" rack with a bunch of GPU's (PCIe switches into PCIe switches?) all connected with a single thunderbolt cable to the host PC! This way you can also turn off the GPU rig when not in use to save on idle power!

To test it I hooked it up to a thunderbolt NVME enclosure with an M.2 to PCIe adapter and boom. 2x MI60 on my laptop!

Totally jank setup right now. It all will be in a nice 19"" rack. Maybe with the new Thunderbolt 5 or at the minimum with the fancy Asmedia Thunderbolt controllers that do PCIe 4.0 upstream. (the current NVME enclosure that I have will do 3.0x4 to the switch card).

The cards together are connected by x16, and I do think they also can talk x16 to each other! I have noticed NO performance loss when using 2x MI60 with tensor parallel in mlc-llm. About 15.2T/s on 70b Q4.

1gb7x5z,Benchmark GGUF models with ONE line of code,"Hi Everyone!

👋We built an **open-sourced tool** to benchmark **GGUF models** with a single line of code. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk/tree/main/nexa/eval)

**Motivations:**

GGUF quantization is crucial for running models locally on devices, but quantizations can dramatically affect model's performance. It's essential to test models post-quantization (how benchmark comes in clutch). But we noticed a couple of challenges:

* No easy, fast way to benchmark quantized GGUF models locally or on self-hosted servers.
* GGUF quantization evaluation results in the existing [benchmarks](http://github.com/terryyz/llm-benchmark) are inconsistent, showing lower scores than the official results from model developers.

**Our Solution:**  
We built a tool that:

* **Benchmarks GGUF models** with **one line of code**.
* Supports **multiprocessing** and **8 evaluation tasks**.
* In our testing, it's the **fastest benchmark** for GGUF models available.

Example:

Benchmark Llama3.2-1B-Instruct Q4\_K\_M quant on the ""ifeval"" dataset for general language understanding. It took 80 minutes on a 4090 with 4 workers for multiprocessing.

1. Type in terminal

`nexa eval Llama3.2-1B-Instruct:q4_K_M --tasks ifeval --num_workers 4`

1gb6jtk,ChatterUI v0.8.0 released - Now with external model loading!,"For the uninitiated, ChatterUI is an android UI for LLMs. 

You can use it to either run models on device (using llama.cpp) or connect to commercial / open source APIs. ChatterUI uses the Character Card format ala Sillytavern and provides low level control (eg, Samplers, Instruct format) for how your messages formatted.


Source: https://github.com/Vali-98/ChatterUI/releases/tag/v0.8.0

Hey LocalLLaMA! Its been a while since the last release, I've been hard at work redoing a lot of screens to improve UX and the general flow of the app. Since we mostly focus on the local features, here are the big changes to how ChatterUI manages local models:

### Remote and Local Mode

The app now splits Remote and Local modes in the main Options drawer:

- Local Mode lets you customize and use your local models on your device.

- Remote Mode lets you connect to various supported APIs



### Local Mode

- Added a new model list heavily inspired by Pocket Pal. This list will show metadata about your model extracted directly from the GGUF file.

- Added **External Model Use** - this option adds a model that will load it from your device storage without needing to copy it into ChatterUI.

- Added a Model Settings Page:

	- CPU Settings  (Max Context, Threads, Batch) have been moved here

	- Local Specific app settings (Autoload On Chat and Save KV) have been moved here

	- Added a `Supported Quantization` section to show compatibility with `Q4_0_4_8` and `Q4_0_4_4` models.

- Sync'd llama.cpp with a newer build. This also introduces XTC sampling to local mode.



### Chats, Characters and User changes and more!

1gb62ud,Guide for using Ministral 8B GGUF with Ollama,"[bartowski](https://huggingface.co/bartowski) uploaded new Ministral-8B ggufs based on the officially merged safetensors

[https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-GGUF)

I tested the Q8 gguf using Ollama and it works perfectly. Previously, there were some issues with large context lengths (2k+), so I tested it with an 8k context length. I gave it a very long article to summarize, and it did a better job than qwen2.5 14B. Both models summarized the article correctly, but Ministral provided more necessary details.

Here is how to import this model into ollama:

1. Download one of the GGUF, for example `Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-Q8_0.gguf`
2. Create a `ModelFile`, and paste these into it: [https://pastebin.com/gjSgn6Ps](https://pastebin.com/gjSgn6Ps)
3. Run this command: `ollama create Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-Q8_0 -f ModelFile`

How can I get a single embedding vector for the whole input - the second documentation link mentions an \`/embedding\` endpoint with a \`content\` parameter (instead of \`input\`). Is this functionality available for the llama-cpp-python server?

the thing is my board only supports a measly 2 cards and the majority of others ive seen have 3 or occasionally 4 full PCIE slots, ive fund the asus z10pw-16 ws but its like 400 quid, theres a supermicro one thats similar but also similarly priced and doesnt seem like itll run without the full chassis

so whats the cheapest possible way i can run more than 4x GPUs in a single rig?

We are now support [Milvus](https://milvus.io/) and [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) cloud & http version. So, you can connect external Vector DB, not in your local, and do optimization on the bigger document set. 

[AutoRAG](https://github.com/Marker-Inc-Korea/AutoRAG) supports many RAG modules and steps. It is the great collection of Advanced RAG field itself.   
We support 7 retrievals, 15 rerankers, 5 passage filters, 3 prompt strategies. Plus augmenters, query expansion, and passage compressor. And we support all kinds of LLM of course.

Quick rundown of what's in it:

* **LocalAI**, for running LLMs/transformer models on a server with a web ui and distributed inferencing
* **LLM Proxy**, for aggregating local OpenAI APIs, as well as adding TLS & api keys.
* **Open WebUI**, for a local web-based AI chat interface.
* **SearXNG**, web search support for Open WebUI
* **ComfyUI**, for running local image diffusion workflows. Can be used standalone or with Open WebUI
* **n8n**, for task automation using local LLMs.
* **Qdrant**, vector store for RAG in n8n.
* **Postgres**, data store for n8n.

This is essentially just a docker compose file for running LLMs and diffusion models locally to then use with n8n and Open WebUI. I have these split between 2 different servers in my cluster, but it should run fine on a single machine, given the resources.

I tried to limit the overall amount of words and keep it to just the code. Mostly because that's what I prefer when I'm trying to figure out how to do something.

1gan3p9,🚀 Introducing Arch - open source intelligent middle-ware for fast and observable agentic apps,"I'm excited to announce Arch - an open source intelligent prompt gateway engineered with (fast) LLMs for the secure handling, robust observability, and seamless integration of prompts with APIs for agentic use cases.

[https://github.com/katanemo/arch](https://github.com/katanemo/arch)

Arch is built on (and by the core contributors of) [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) with the belief that:

Prompts are nuanced and opaque user requests, which require the same capabilities as traditional HTTP requests including secure handling, intelligent routing, robust observability, and integration with backend (API) systems for personalization – all outside business logic.

Engineered with sub-billion LLMs, Arch handles the critical but undifferentiated tasks related to the handling and processing of prompts, including detecting and rejecting [jailbreak](https://github.com/verazuo/jailbreak_llms) attempts, intelligently calling ""backend"" APIs to fulfill the user's request represented in a prompt, routing to and offering disaster recovery between upstream LLMs, and managing the observability of prompts and LLM interactions in a centralized way.

**Core Features**:

* Built on [Envoy](https://envoyproxy.io): Arch runs alongside application servers, and builds on top of Envoy's proven HTTP management and scalability features to handle ingress and egress traffic related to prompts and LLMs.
* [Function Calling](https://huggingface.co/katanemo/Arch-Function-3B) for fast agents and RAG apps. Arch uses its SOTA LLMs to handles fast, cost-effective, and accurate prompt-based tasks like function/API calling, and parameter extraction from prompts.
* Prompt [Guard](https://huggingface.co/collections/katanemo/arch-guard-6702bdc08b889e4bce8f446d): Arch centralizes prompt guardrails to prevent jailbreak attempts and ensure safe user interactions without writing a single line of code.
* Traffic Management: Arch manages LLM calls, offering smart retries, automatic cut over, and resilient upstream connections for continuous availability.
* Standards-based Observability: Arch uses the W3C Trace Context standard to enable complete request tracing across applications, ensuring compatibility with observability tools, and provides metrics to monitor latency, token usage, and error rates, helping optimize AI application performance.",2024-10-23 15:20:12,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gan3p9/introducing_arch_open_source_intelligent/

Previous version did 27.5%.,"Ai Explained, an AI entousiast known for its rigorous and scientifically approached YouTube videos, created a benchmark addressing the temporal and spacial cognitive abilities of LLMs, a few months ago. It gained popularity because many believe this bench is accurately testing the raw reasoning capabilities of the tested language models: the human baseline is over 80%, while models like GPT 4o are scoring 17%. Finally, it is fully private, ensuring no contamination.

As you saw in the title, the new Sonnet version is climbing the leaderboard, from 27.5% to 41.4%, right before o1-preview at 41.7%, so in the margin of errors.

I had the chance to test it personally today, and I like it: It does not produce longs answers when unnecessary, and I had less trouble asking for full files refactoring without having holes everywhere. In my use cases, it knew when to be lazier and when to do the opposite. Also, one area in which it excelled was converting natural language to complex FFmpeg commands. Every time I got an error, it managed to fix it the first try, while that was less the case before.

1gajww0,Market for an end-user AI-in-a-box product/platform,"I'm planning a custom build around the upcoming 5090, and as a part of the process I looked for any pre-built machines for local LLM to get ideas, but I didn't find any.  Not entirely surprising given the stage in the evolution of this tech - there's probably not much of a market among the kind of folks running local models given they have the knowledge and skills to build their own rig.

Part of my interest in running LLMs locally is that I have a personal journal that is 1000s of pages long (starting in 1988) and would like to have that integrated into a model for chat, but given the personal nature of the content I would never use an online chat service.

Although I'm planning to build a machine with enough power to explore a range of uses and technologies, I found myself thinking about a potential market for a small, headless box for consumers to have a private platform for doing various AI/LLM related stuff.  An AI-in-a-box, more or less like an ""appliance"".

One way to go with something like this would be to make it a ""white label"" box that vendors could brand and fine-tune for their product.  

Another way to go is that it's a general purpose box that provides a super-friendly ability to select among curated models and functionality within some type of marketplace.

I think there is a lot of well-justified fear related to privacy and safety when it comes to AI, and I suspect there will be a market for a product that is all about local execution.

Just beginning to think about this and given I'm relatively new to this domain, I'd be curious if other folks see this as a viable market opportunity, or if there are products on the horizon that are addressing this need at the consumer level.",2024-10-23 13:04:30,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gajww0/market_for_an_enduser_aiinabox_productplatform/

Get a good small/optimised model from Hugging Face. Dont really mind what for - i like text and pictures and creative things. Deploy it on Google colab. Distribute the compute needed to run it with my local machine to raise the (albeit limited) bar of potential performance (supplement collab's free tier with my own potato)

I was hoping this would give me an intro dive into deploying and inferencing models (I dont want to try training yet, but i want to understand deeper than just APIs), and also learning some distributed computing would be cool, and I thought in theory would fit nicely with the goal of overcoming local low specs.

1gahzpo,Claude Computer Use: A deep dive into vision agents,"Another week, another major launch from a leading AI lab—this time from Anthropic. Anthropic has introduced some exciting updates to its Claude Sonnet and Haiku line-up. Notably, Claude Sonnet 3.5 can now operate a computer like a human, given the right tools, and this is big news for everyone working in AI.

So, as someone who’s been working with Agents for a long time, I tested the model using the demo image from Anthropic.

Please refer to my [article](https://composio.dev/blog/claude-computer-use/) for a comprehensive, deep dive into the model, use cases with examples, and my observations.

Here are my overall observations about the model.

# What did I like?

* This is the first model I tested that was so good at determining the coordinates of the elements on the screen.
* It was good at dissecting prompts and images and providing excellent reasoning to finish the tasks.
* The default Computer tool is good enough for simple use cases like web researching, creating spreadsheets, etc.
* The model could accurately use a cursor, scroll the screen, click the buttons, type text, etc.

# Scope for improvements.

The model is slow for most tasks, relying on sending screenshots to LLM for understanding.

* The model is too expensive to perform anything meaningful.
* It is still in public beta, making many mistakes, but it will improve in the next iterations.

Let me know if you have tried it yet, and share your experiences. Also, what kind of use cases do you find computer use can be beneficial?",2024-10-23 11:38:24,193,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gahzpo/claude_computer_use_a_deep_dive_into_vision_agents/
1gaffza,Most intelligent model that fits onto a single 3090?,"I normally only use(d) Q8 quants and never gave anything under 75GB a second look.

Due to [*reasons*] I am now down to a single 3090 GPU and must humble myself before the LLM gods while atoning for my snobbery.

I would primarily use the LLM model for tech help (server stuff and mild coding) for myself, so it would need to be as intelligent as possible. And it's running on an x670e, 64GB of DDR5, and 7800x3D. 

I would normally think that Qwen 2.5 would be the go-to model. But unsure which quant would work best. Or perhaps there's another one?

I was also thinking about using HuggingFace Chat...those are full size models and would probably give me better performance than anything I can squeeze into a 24GB of VRAM?

1gacgr1,Best LLM to summarize long texts and answer a question,"In my use case, for each question that the user asks, RAG will retrieve around 5 most-related documents, some can be long but most are short and medium. I then feed these 5 documents into a LLM and ask it to use the texts to answer the original question. Right now I am using Google Gemini Flash 8B since it is fast and has long context-window, which is needed if one or more of the 5 documents are long. I don't want to summarize the documents first before sending to LLM since I am afraid the summarization may cause data loss.

My question is: for this particular task, what is the best model (open-source or closed-source)? Gemini works for me now due to the context window but I've noticed some of its answers are not really good, so I am looking to see whether there are better alternatives out there.

1gabmhf,Old vs. New Claude 3.5: A Quick Review of Speed and Output Quality,"Was using the older Claude 3.5 model for data generation. Its responses were slower but very detailed and comprehensive. This morning, Switched to the newer version of Claude 3.5 and noticed a significant speed increase. However, a bit skeptical, so decided to compare the two by taking 10 samples from each model and analyzing their responses. Here are my observations:

**Test Setup:**

* Used the same prompt (very detailed prompt \~5k tokens), same private data, and hyperparameter settings (e.g., temperature = 0) for both models.

**Old Claude 3.5:**

* The responses were very detailed and comprehensive.
* Instruction adherence was not perfect; I often didn’t receive proper JSON responses. About 1-2 out of 10 outputs had formatting issues despite using detailed prompts.
* The responses were slow.
* However, the quality of the results was quite good overall.

**New Claude 3.5:**

* The new model’s responses felt shorter like it was eager to wrap up quickly.
* The instruction following was excellent, 10 out of 10 outputs were properly formatted JSON, following the instructions perfectly.
* The responses were much faster.
* However, the quality of the content seemed lacking, more like summaries rather than the detailed explanations I got from the old version.

Just wanted to share initial experience with the community, it could be subjective to the dataset I used, so I might be wrong. Curious to hear other thoughts!",2024-10-23 07:15:54,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gabmhf/old_vs_new_claude_35_a_quick_review_of_speed_and/

1ga25gj,🚀 Introducing Fast Apply - Replicate Cursor's Instant Apply model,"I'm excited to announce **Fast Apply**, an open-source, fine-tuned **Qwen2.5 Coder Model** designed to quickly and accurately apply code updates provided by advanced models to produce a fully edited file.

This project was inspired by Cursor's blog post (now deleted). You can view the archived version [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240823050616/https://www.cursor.com/blog/instant-apply).

When using tools like Aider, updating long files with SEARCH/REPLACE blocks can be very slow and costly. Fast Apply addresses this by allowing large models to focus on writing the actual code updates without the need to repeat the entire file.

It can effectively handle natural update snippets from Claude or GPT without further instructions, like:

    // ... existing code ...
    {edit 1}
    // ... other code ...
    {edit 2} 
    // ... another code ... 

**Performance using a fast provider (Fireworks):**

* **1.5B Model:** \~340 tok/s
* **7B Model:** \~150 tok/s

These speeds make Fast Apply practical for everyday use, and the models are lightweight enough to run locally with ease.

Everything is open-source, including the models, data, and scripts.

1ga1zq6,Renting GPU Cluster Cloud Services for running Inference for High-End Open Sourced LLMs,"I have a web application that is essentially an OpenAI api wrapper, that helps users for a specific goal. For the time being, I want to switch to a local, open sourced model and power LLM conversations on a cloud gpu cluster. The LLM must be capable of delivering good reasoning generate/execute proper code, so 7-13B models will probably not be enough. I was thinking of running 30-70B models, so I'm thinking I probably need at least 50-100GB VRAM., correct me if i am wrong. 

This version of the website will only be up for 2-4 weeks, and the reason for switch is for research purposes. How much would money and effort would this cost me? Has anyone here ran something like this? According to my estimations it would be about $4k for one month, but it might just be an off guess so please let me know.

If not, I will just use Groq or NVIDIA API as a last resort kind of thing, but it would be great if I could use them locally and run it myself without relying on another company API.

It gets the job done getting a couple tokens per second on models as large as 32b, and almost 1tk/second on qwen2.5 72b. It can also generate 512x512 images using flux schnell in about 100 seconds, which is good enough for me.

With all that being said I would love to be able to run even some smaller models a bit faster than that, and being able to offload either flux or the llm to gpu so that I can have both running at the same time would be nice.

The issue is, of course, money. I can get 2 P102-100 gpus with 10gb of ram each for about $80 on ebay, which is way cheaper than getting even a single 16GB card. But the p102-100 draws up to 300 watts, and my workstation, though it has a 700 watt power supply, is proprietary and only has 2 6 pin pcie cables, capable of supplying 75 watts each, with another 75 watts coming from the pcie slot that adds up to 150 watts, which is theoretically within the spec for powerlimits on the p102-100 which can have a -50% power limit set.

1g9qshp,Spent weeks building a no-code web automation tool... then Anthropic dropped their Computer Use API 💔,"Just need to vent. Been pouring my heart into this project for weeks - a tool that lets anyone record and replay their browser actions without coding. The core idea was simple but powerful: you click ""record,"" do your actions (like filling forms, clicking buttons, extracting data), and the tool saves everything. Then you can replay those exact actions anytime.

I was particularly excited about this AI fallback system I was planning - if a recorded action failed (like if a website changed its layout), the AI would figure out what you were trying to do and complete it anyway. Had built most of the recording/playback engine, basic error handling, and was just getting to the good part with AI integration.

Then today I saw Anthropic's Computer Use API announcement. Their AI can literally browse the web and perform actions autonomously. No recording needed. No complex playback logic. Just tell it what to do in plain English and it handles everything. My entire project basically became obsolete overnight.

The worst part? I genuinely thought I was building something useful. Something that would help people automate their repetitive web tasks without needing to learn coding. Had all these plans for features like:

* Sharing automation templates with others
* Visual workflow builder
* Cross-browser support
* Handling dynamic websites
* AI-powered error recovery

You know that feeling when you're building something you truly believe in, only to have a tech giant casually drop a solution that's 10x more advanced? Yeah, that's where I'm at right now.

Not sure whether to:

1. Pivot the project somehow
2. Just abandon it
3. Keep building anyway and find a different angle

I'm trying to do an assistant that should have image capability and summarization, and voice recognition.

Currently I'm using faster-whisper, minicpm 2.6 and gemma2 27b, and I also need a small model for function calling (this uses more than 24gb). Currently I'm developing using vast. 

I also would like, in the future, try to finetune some of those for my needs.

I have only a single free PCIe slot available on my current home lab server (the others are used by storage and networking), so the dual 3090 is not a viable option.

My main candidate was an A6000 but Recently I saw an used v100 32gb and I was wondering if is a viable option, it would cost less than half of an a6000 and my benchmarks says that's slightly faster (I would need a custom cooling solution, but I own a 3d printer so it should be doable).

Try it here: [https://whatllm.vercel.app/](https://whatllm.vercel.app/) 

--

After my simple [LLM comparison tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g5ol41/i_made_a_tool_to_find_the_cheapestfastest_llm_api/) hit 2,000+ users last week, I dove deep into what the community really needs. The result? A complete rebuild with real performance data across every major provider.

**The new version lets you:**   
  
- Find the cheapest provider for any specific model (some surprising findings here)   
- Compare quality scores against pricing (spoiler: expensive ≠ better)   
- Filter by what actually matters to you (context window, speed, quality score)   
- See everything in interactive charts   
- Discover alternative providers you might not know about

**## What this solves:**

✓ ""Which provider offers the cheapest Claude/Llama/GPT alternative?""  
✓ ""Is Anthropic really worth the premium over Mistral?""  
✓ ""Why am I paying 3x more than necessary for the same model?""



# ## Key findings from the data:

**1. Price Disparities:**  
Example:

* Qwen 2.5 72B has a quality score of 75 and priced around $0.36/M tokens
* Claude 3.5 Sonnet has a quality score of 77 and costs $6.00/M tokens
* **That's 94% cheaper for just 2 points less on quality**

**2. Performance Insights:**  
Example:

* Cerebras's Llama 3.1 70B outputs 569.2 tokens/sec at $0.60/M tokens
* While Amazon Bedrock's version costs $0.99/M tokens but only outputs 31.6 tokens/sec
* **Same model, 18x faster at 40% lower price**

**## What's new in v2:**

- Interactive price vs performance charts  
- Quality scores for 200+ model variants  
- Real-world Speed & latency data  
- Context window comparisons  
- Cost calculator for different usage patterns

**## Some surprising findings:**

1. The ""premium"" providers aren't always better - data shows   
2. Several new providers outperform established ones in price and speed  
3. The sweet spot for price/performance is actually not that hard to visualise once you know your use case

**## Technical details:**

- Data Source: [artificial-analysis.com](http://artificial-analysis.com)  
- Updated: October 2024  
- Models Covered: GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Mistral, + 20 others  
- Providers: Most major platforms + emerging ones (will be adding some)

Because it takes so long though (as expected), I decided to try and develop with Groq. It's super fast, but the results are way poorer.

I suspect this has to do with ""temperature"" or other things I've started reading about, but no idea really. Or it may be that the configs or the machine used by Groq are different and therefore different results. Reminder: I'm super noob on this.

1g9esr0,The Best NSFW Roleplay Model - Mistral-Small-22B-ArliAI-RPMax-v1.1,"I've tried over a hundred models over the past two years - from high parameter low precision to low parameter high precision - if it fits in 24GB, I've at least tried it out. So, to say I was shocked when a recently released 22B model ended up being the best model I've ever used, would be an understatement. Yet here we are.

I put a lot of thought into wondering what makes this model *the best* roleplay model I've ever used. The most obvious reason is the uniqueness in its responses. I switched to Qwen-2.5 32B as a litmus test, and I find that when you're roleplaying with 99% of models, there's just some stock phrases they will ***without fail*** resort back to. It's a little hard to explain, but if you've had multiple conversations with the same character card, it's like there's a particular response they can give that indicates you've reached a checkpoint, and if you don't start over, you're gonna end up having a conversation that you've already had a thousands times before. This model doesn't do that. It's legit had responses before that caught me so off-guard, I had to look away from my screen for a moment to process the fact that there's not a human being on the other end - something I haven't done since the first day I chatted with AI.

Additionally, it never over-describes actions, nor does it talk like it's trying to fill a word count. It says what needs to be said - a perfect mix of short and longer responses that fit the situation. It also does this when balancing the ratio of narration/inner monologue vs quotes. You'll get a response that's a paragraph of narration and talking, and the very next response will be less than 10 words with no narration. This added layer of unpredictability in response patterns is, again... the type of behavior that you'd find when RPing with a human.

I could go into its attention to detail regarding personalities, but it'd be much easier for you to just experience it yourself instead of trying to explain it.

* I am a Python developer experienced with FastAPI.
* Our current application has static text entry fields and performs RAG to generate responses. We have 20k (and growing) documents and have indexed them in such a way that a reference to the lines of text from the source document are maintained - so not wanting to use any out of the box RAG tooling that comes with a UI - I would prefer to use our existing RAG via API as a ""tool"".
* Wanting a more interactive, chat-style interface similar to ChatGPT or Claude.
* Plan to include function and tool calling functionality.

Ideal library:

1. Simple, standalone UI components without built-in logic or state management.
2. Basic features like regenerating responses, chat history, user management, and chat export/sharing.
3. Flexibility to integrate our own chat related but non standard components e.g. our bespoke PDF viewer and Knowledge Graph viewer.

1g91mik,Advice on scaling project with backend LLMs for servers with multiple models and making better decisions for demo/production,"Hello,  
I am a beginner working on an AI project for commercial use, and I’m currently stuck. I’ve been using three models: Faster-Whisper, LLaMA 3.1 8B, and Parler-TTS. I hooked them up using Hugging Face's `transformers` library. My main bottleneck right now is the LLaMA model for real-time responses. I initially used the [shenzhi-wang/Llama3-8B-Chinese-Chat at v2](https://huggingface.co/shenzhi-wang/Llama3-8B-Chinese-Chat/tree/v2) model (v2 gguf), but it struggled with specific role-based JSON responses.

I switched to LLaMA 3.1 8B and 3.2 3B while using and testing all of these, and while they improved the accuracy of the responses, the speed dropped significantly. The response time is now around 3-4 seconds, whereas before it was closer to 0.5 seconds.

I’ve tried performance optimizations from [huggingface-llama-recipes/performance\_optimization at main · huggingface/huggingface-llama-recipes](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface-llama-recipes/tree/main/performance_optimization), but haven't seen much improvement. I also encountered a strange error when trying to compile with `torch` (specifically with `model.forward`) and I dont get any with just `model`.

Here’s my current setup:

* **Hardware**: NVIDIA 3090 on a Windows PC
* **Goal**: Achieve real-time responses within 1-2 seconds, using all three models. For context, I start streaming audio and compute 2 seconds of audio in 3 sec but I could change model I guess.

I’m considering the following options, but I’d love your advice on which approach to prioritize:

1. **Dockerize the setup and test on H100 cloud GPUs**, then optimize performance once it works on that infrastructure as I could use it in future for scaling.
2. **Check out the new gguf version of LLaMA 3.1** (like [shenzhi-wang/Llama3.1-8B-Chinese-Chat]()), since the previous gguf model was faster or some others.
3. **Revisit LLaMA-cpp** (not `cpp-python`, since I ran into dependency issues). I had a better performance with LLaMA-cpp, but the Docker setup confused me. I shifted to `transformers` for model management and download automation, but that has slowed things down. I’m considering whether to switch back or figure out llama-cpp-python.
4. **Experiment with other models like Qwen or Mistral** for specific roles (like role-playing), though I’m unsure if they’ll outperform LLaMA for my use case.
5. **Explore Ollama** for ease of use, but I feel LLaMA-cpp might still be better for performance, especially when planning to switch to vLLM or LangChain later (although that would require reworking the system, and I’m short on time).

What would you recommend as the fastest way to prove these models can achieve real-time responses (around 1-2 seconds sequentially? Any suggestions on improving the performance, especially in a production setting, would be appreciated as I need to figure out everything alone.",2024-10-21 14:39:21,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g91mik/advice_on_scaling_project_with_backend_llms_for/

I've been digging into BERT like models and reading up on progression of transformers across time, and it feels like the two sides (LLM implementations and the sort of ""Non-LLM transformer research"") sort of got disconnected sometime around 2018/2019 and stopped learning from each other. Considering how much effort and time has gone into things like Grouped Query Attention, SWA, etc. it seems like exactly the type of thing LLM implementations would be looking to implement come hell or high water. If I'm reading correctly it is seemingly proven to be a near drop in replacement (same weights, etc.) for full soft max attention that uses linear memory instead of quadratic memory, even improves on performance pretty drastically with any recent sized context window, but for some reason is just sort of... ignored? Am I missing some history here, is this just a matter of divergent architecture that hasn't learned from another segment of ML, or else what am I missing?

I have 12GB of VRAM on my 6750xt and I wanted to compare which one would bring me the best results/bang for the buck

Used [koboldcpp ROCM](https://github.com/YellowRoseCx/koboldcpp-rocm) as an backend



|Model|Size|Time to finish benchmark|Result|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Replete-LLM-V2.5-Qwen-14b-Q5\_K\_M|10.2 GB|4 hours 52 seconds|63.66|

|qwen2.5-7b-ins-v3-Q8\_0|8GB|1 hours 12 minutes 35 seconds|52.44|

  
It appears that the general consensus that more parameters = better applies in this case too.

What i found intresting while running the tests is that there were many occasions where the models just started rambling incessantly until they reached the maximum 2048 output tokens

Example: \`\`the answer is (F)\`\`\` repeated until the max was reached

 \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \`\`\` \` repeated until the limit was reached

I assume if the models decided not to have an episode, the time to finish the benchmark would have been shorter but it is what it is I guess

  
I originally planned to do more models(gemma,phi,llama 3.1,mistral,etc) to compare how well they do but considering the time needed to be invested I stopped here.

It is a platform that empowers AI agents with third-party tools and integrations like GitHub, Gmail, etc. When OpenAI dropped the GPT-4 function calling, we realized developers would need this to create complex, agent-driven solutions.

With Composio, we’ve created a space where developers can access all the tools and integrations they need in one place. So, you don’t have to spend precious engineering hours building integrations optimized for tool calling from scratch.

So far, things are going well. We have individual users, agencies, and a few large enterprises testing the product. However, the feedback loop has been a bit slow and we want to move fast, so I’d love for you to try it and share **your thoughts** on the [product](https://composio.dev/) **and let me know how and where we can improve it.**

Here is a brief description of our product, what it is and what it offers to AI developers.

# So, what is Composio?

Composio is a platform that offers over 100 tools and integrations, from GitHub, Slack, and Linear to Salesforce and Google Apps (Gmail, Calendar, Sheet, etc.) to connect with your AI agents to build complex automation.

Integrations range from CRM, HRM, sales, and marketing to Dev, Social media, and productivity, allowing you to build custom AI agents to automate complex processes.

# What can you do with Composio?

* **Integrate third-party services** in your AI apps without worrying about user authentication and authorization. Composio takes care of that for you, supporting OAuth, API Key, and basic authentication so you can execute tools seamlessly on behalf of your app users.
* Soon, you'll also be able to adopt a hybrid approach. If you prefer to handle integrations outside Composio, you can still benefit from its optimized tools, triggers, and other features.
* **Manage execution environments at the tool level to optimize performance, security, and cost efficiency**. Composio lets you choose the best execution environment for each tool: Local, Docker, E2B, Fly io, Lambda, and more. This ensures you get the most out of each tool without compromising speed or cost.
* You can **monitor detailed logs** for every function call the LLM makes, including input arguments, return values, and timestamps for each execution. This lets you track and optimize latency and measure the accuracy of each tool call, helping you fine-tune your AI workflows.
* With Composio, you can easily import custom API definitions (OpenAPI, Postman, Swagger) to add support for your **custom tools automatically**.

# Why do you need Composio?

You will need Composio if

* You are building AI agents that require interaction with multiple integrations. For instance, an SWE agent, where you will need access to GitHub, Jira, Linear, Slack, and specialized tools like Code indexing, file search, etc.
* You are developing internal AI automation workflows that may require integration with custom tools and other third-party integrations.

# Why do you not need Composio?

If your use case involves only one or two integrations, you will probably be better off building your own. However, you still can use Composio.

# Composio for Non-AI automation

Even if AI automation isn't your focus, you can still use Composio's integrations directly in their vanilla form. We offer native support for Python and an SDK for JavaScript, and we plan to expand to other languages based on community interest.

Thanks! I’d really appreciate your feedback on the product, as well as any suggestions for improving the [documentation](https://docs.composio.dev/introduction/intro/overview), l[anding page](https://www.composio.dev/), or anything else you think could be enhanced.",2024-10-21 09:07:54,130,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g8tf0c/i_am_building_a_comprehensive_tooling_solution/

1g8t4uh,Tool Calling with Small Local Models (Llama 3.2 3B),"I am working on a POC for work that runs everything in less than 4GB of vram as a demonstration of what can be achieved with the default GPUs that are shipped with our corporate laptops. I’m running Whisper Large V3 turbo for STT, and Llama 3.2 3B Q4 for the LLM. 

I am trying to get function calling working with Ollama in the backend, but it seems hellbent on calling tools - even when a simple text response is all that’s necessary.

I tried introducing a text_response tool to parse out the reply and treat as a text reply, but the reply often gets truncated at weird points.

Any recommendations for small tool calling models - or better leveraging what I have? I need the ability to use tools CONDITIONALLY. I’m otherwise quite impressed with this model for a q4 3B…

1g8t3zx,OpenAI's new Swarm Agent framework is too minimal?,"OpenAI released the swarm library to build agents recently. The minimalism of the library is mind-blowing: wrote about it[ here](https://offnote.substack.com/p/building-ai-agent-swarms).  I think all they added was an agent **handoff** construct, camouflaged it as yet another **tool** and claimed the ability to design complex agents.

Compared to other agent frameworks, they are missing a couple of layers/features:

- **memory layer.** agents are stateless. developer faces the additional responsibility of maintaining history and filtering history into per turn context. In comparison, Crew has short- and long-term memory.

- **no explicit execution graphs**. hard to steer control if want to enforce global communication patterns, say round-robin among agents on some condition. Autogen has external manager to orchestrate.

- **no message passing**. many agent frameworks carry out orchestration via sending messages between agents. Do we lose something by not having explicit messages between agents?

- what else?

If you've been building agents with other frameworks, I'm curious to hear what you think about the missing layers of abstraction.

Are complex Agents harder to build without these features? or Agent handoff is all you need? What do you think?",2024-10-21 08:55:58,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g8t3zx/openais_new_swarm_agent_framework_is_too_minimal/

1g8p7zr,A few questions on the architecture of Meta's Movie Gen model,"I went through the Meta Movie Gen paper to understand their pipeline.  I'm mostly comfortable with the architecture at this point, but there are a few places where I'm still not sure what's going on.  Hoping to get some clarity

1) The conversion from TAE output latents to the transformer input embeddings.  The paper has this paragraph:

>As discussed in Section 3.1.1, we perform generation in a learned latent space representation of the video. This latent code is of shape T x C x H x W . To prepare inputs for the Transformer backbone, the video latent code is first ‘patchified’ using a 3D convolutional layer (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) and then flattened to yield a 1D sequence. The 3D convolutional layer uses a kernel size of k_t x k_h x k_w with a stride equal to the kernel size and projects it into the same dimensions as needed by the Transformer backbone. Thus, the total number of tokens input to the Transformer backbone is THW/(k_t k_h k_w). We use k_t = 1 and k_h = k_w = 2, i.e., we produce 2 x 2 spatial patches.

Here, why isn't the channel dimension mentioned?  Shouldn't the kernel be 5-dimensional, including the input channels and output channels?  And if so, is the number of output channels equal to the transformer embedding dimension?

2) Right after that, the paper talks about factorized learnable embeddings:

>We use a factorized learnable positional embedding to enable arbitrary size, aspect ratio, and video length (De- hghani et al., 2024) inputs to the Transformer. Absolute embeddings of D dimensions can be denoted as a mapping  phi(i) : [0, maxLen] -> R^D where i denotes the absolute index of the patch. We convert the ‘patchified’ tokens, i.e., output of the 3D convolutional layer, into separate embeddings  phi_h,  phi_w and  phi_t of spatial h, w, and temporal t coordinates...

How can the embeddings be separated by dimension after they've already been flattened to 1-D?  Shouldn't the positional embeddings be added before the ""3-D"" convolution, when we still have the temporal and spatial coordinates isolated?

3) How do adaptive layer norm blocks work?  I looked up the original reference in Peebles and Xie, which says:

> Rather than directly learn dimensionwise scale and shift parameters γ and β, we regress them from the sum of the embedding vectors of t and c

I don't really understand what is meant by the word ""regress"" here, or how γ and β are obtained from t and c.  I also don't understand how this applies to Movie Gen, which has no c vector.",2024-10-21 06:05:47,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g8p7zr/a_few_questions_on_the_architecture_of_metas/

Abstract:

>Positional bias in large language models (LLMs) hinders their ability to effectively process long inputs. A prominent example is the ""lost in the middle"" phenomenon, where LLMs struggle to utilize relevant information situated in the middle of the input. While prior research primarily focuses on single pieces of relevant information, real-world applications often involve multiple relevant information pieces. To bridge this gap, we present LongPiBench, a benchmark designed to assess positional bias involving multiple pieces of relevant information. Thorough experiments are conducted with five commercial and six open-source models. These experiments reveal that while most current models are robust against the ""lost in the middle"" issue, there exist significant biases related to the spacing of relevant information pieces. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating and reducing positional biases to advance LLM's capabilities.

<snip from Results>  


>4.1 Impact of Absolute Position As illustrated by the blue lines in Figure 3, we progres- sively shift the interval of relevant information from the beginning to the end and observed that while a few open-source models like Qwen 2.5 (7B) (Qwen, 2024) and WizardLM 2 (8×22B) (Xu et al., 2023) still suffer from the severe ""lost in the middle"" phenomenon, commercial models and larger open-source models do not exhibit effects related to absolute position. This outcome significantly surpasses previous evaluations (Liu et al., 2023), indicating that current long- context models have achieved greater robustness against variations in absolute position of relevant information.

>4.2 Impact of Relative Position As illustrated by the orange lines in Figure 3, we progressively increase the distance between relevant pieces of information and observe that all open-source and commercial models exhibit a significant bias toward different relative positions. This bias is characterized by an initial rapid decline in performance followed by a more gradual decrease. Even in straightforward retrieval tasks, relative position bias can lead to a 20–30% reduction in recall rates for competent commercial models. These findings indicate that the relative positioning among multiple relevant pieces of information is a serious and unresolved issue, which may substantially undermine the effectiveness of long-text language models in practical applications.

>4.3 Further Analysis Effect of Parameter Size When selecting models for evaluation, we included four variants from the Qwen 2.5 Family (Qwen, 2024) with differing parameter sizes. These models exhibit no significant differences in architecture, training methods, or training data. By analyzing their performance under identical positional information features, we can isolate the impact of parameter size on the robustness to positional bias. As illustrated in Figure 3, for absolute position bias, we found that simply increasing the model parameters from 7B to 14B—while keeping architecture, training methods, and data constant substantially mitigates the ""lost in the middle"" (Liu et al., 2023) issue. This suggests that robustness to absolute positions may be an ""emergent ability"" (Wei et al., 2022) and increasing the number of parameters can significantly enhances it. In contrast, regarding biases related to relative posi- tional information, augmenting the number of parameters only yielded minor quantitative improvements and did not alter the pronounced bias trend. This trend remains largely unchanged even in commercial models with approximately hundreds of billions of parameters. These findings indicate that merely increasing parameter size is insufficient to develop robustness to relative positions, and new techniques may be necessary

>Effect of Query-Aware Contextualization Liu et al. (2023) demonstrated that the placement of the query  
(beginning or end of the context) significantly affects the performance of decoder-only models due to unidirectional attention. When the query is placed after the context, the LLM cannot attend to the query token while processing the context tokens. As shown in Figure 4, our experiments on GPT- 4o-mini (OpenAI, 2024) and Qwen-2.5-14B (Qwen, 2024) corroborate this observation and confirm that it also holds for bias caused by relative position changes. Specifically, when the query is positioned at the end of the context, the model’s performance is significantly worse compared to scenarios where the query is placed at the beginning or both at the beginning and the end. However, the difference between having the query solely at the beginning versus having it at both the beginning and the end varies depending on the model. This indicates that for decoder-only long-text models, positioning the query before the context is of paramount importance.  
</snip from Results>

Conclusion:

>This study investigates a new category of positional bias involving multiple relevant pieces of information in long-context LLMs through three key contributions.

>(1) Benchmark Development: We introduce LONG- PIBENCH, the most comprehensive benchmark for eval- uating positional bias in long-text LLMs, assessing both absolute and relative biases.  
(2) Comprehensive Evaluation: Using LONG-PIBENCH, we evaluated eleven popular LLMs, investigated the ""lost in the middle"" phenomenon, and identified novel yet significant biases related to the relative positioning of multiple relevant pieces of information.  
(3) Insightful Findings: Our experiments show that while modern LLMs have improved robustness against absolute positional biases, they are highly sensitive to the distance between relevant pieces of information.

>Performance declines sharply as the distance increases before stabilizing. We also explore how model size and query-aware contextualization impact these biases. These findings emphasize the necessity of continuously mitigating positional biases in long-text models",2024-10-20 23:16:44,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g8j4h3/paper_distance_between_relevant_information/

Relying on a phone is kinda unsatisfying, although admittedly far simpler.

So it's going to need a mic and speaker in each room, but it seems like overkill to have a full-blown speech model running all the time in each room. Maybe all the mics could be mixed into a single input to the central AI (but that wouldn't scale well and it wouldn't know where to reply to), or maybe a pi in each room doing some simple audio monitoring, then feeding to the central AI when it detects voice or an activation word. I'm not a big fan of activation words though because you want the AI to have recent context as well when you ask a question.

nGPT by Nvidia is a new version of GPT that forces vectors to lie on a hypersphere, leading to some key improvements:

• **Speed**: 4 to 20 times faster than GPT, achieving the same performance in far fewer training steps.

• **Simplicity**: No need for weight decay or special learning rate adjustments, making it easier to train.

• **Longer Sequences**: nGPT handles longer text sequences better than it was trained on.

By constraining vectors to a hypersphere:

• Matrix multiplications act like measuring vector similarities.

• The Transformer works like an optimizer for the hypersphere.

Analysis of nGPT shows:

• Attention and MLP blocks make smaller adjustments to hidden states compared to traditional Transformers.

• Scaling factors for normalization remain stable across layers.

nGPT seems like promising approach to more efficient and effective language models in the future.

1g8bwkw,COGNITIVE OVERLOAD ATTACK: PROMPT INJECTION FOR LONG CONTEXT,"Paper: **COGNITIVE OVERLOAD ATTACK: PROMPT INJECTION FOR LONG CONTEXT**  
1. 🔍 What do humans and LLMs have in common?  
They both struggle with cognitive overload! 🤯 In our latest study, we dive deep into In-Context Learning (ICL) and uncover surprising parallels between human cognition and LLM behavior.  
Authors: [Bibek Upadhayay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibibek/), [Vahid Behzadan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vahid-behzadan/) , [amin karbasi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amin-karbasi-5025335/)  
  
2. 🧠 Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) helps explain why too much information can overwhelm a human brain. But what happens when we apply this theory to LLMs? The result is fascinating—LLMs, just like humans, can get overloaded! And their performance degrades as the cognitive load increases. We render the image of a unicorn 🦄 with TikZ code created by LLMs during different levels of cognitive overload.

https://preview.redd.it/ez1tcxr0uzvd1.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcf37b6104bdf8b83f36e58ae494aec1f9e21064

3. 🚨 Here's where it gets critical: We show that attackers can exploit this cognitive overload in LLMs, breaking safety mechanisms with specially designed prompts. We jailbreak the model by inducing cognitive overload, forcing its safety mechanism to fail.  
  
  
Here are the attack demos in Claude-3-Opus and GPT-4.



https://i.redd.it/3htrc5thuzvd1.gif



https://i.redd.it/623i55tjuzvd1.gif

4. 📊 Our experiments used advanced models like GPT-4, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus, Llama-3-70B-Instruct, and Gemini-1.5-Pro. The results? Staggering attack success rates—up to 99.99% !

 5. This level of vulnerability has major implications for LLM safety. If attackers can easily bypass safeguards through overload, what does this mean for AI security in the real world?  
  
6. What’s the solution? We propose using insights from cognitive neuroscience to enhance LLM design. By incorporating cognitive load management into AI, we can make models more resilient to adversarial attacks.

I have a repo that lets LLMs directly interact with Vision models (Lucid_Vision), I wanted to add two new models to the code (GOT-OCR and Aria). 

I have another repo that already uses these two models (Lucid_Autonomy).  I thought this was an easy task for Claude and ChatGPT, I would just give them Lucid_Autonomy and Lucid_Vision and have them integrate the model utilization from one to the other....nope omg what a waste of time.

Lucid_Autonomy is 1500 lines of code, and Lucid_Vision is 850 lines of code.

Claude:

Claude kept trying to fix a function from Lucid_Autonomy and not work on Lucid_Vision code, it worked on several functions that looked good, but it kept getting stuck on a function from Lucid_Autonomy and would not focus on Lucid_Vision.

I had to walk Claude through several parts of the code that it forgot to update.

Finally, when I was maybe about to get something good from Claude, I exceeded my token limit and was on cooldown!!!


ChatGPTo with Canvas:

Was just terrible, it would not rewrite all the necessary code.  Even when I pointed out functions from Lucid_Vision that needed to be updated, chatgpt would just gaslight me and try to convince me they were updated and in the chat already?!?


Mistral-Large-Instruct-2047:

My golden model, why did I even try to use the paid SOTA models (I exported all of my chat gpt conversations and am unsubscribing when I receive my conversations via email).

I gave it all 1500 and 850 lines of code and with very minimal guidance, the model did exactly what I needed it to do.  All offline!  

I have the conversation here if you don't believe me:

I limit the token sampled to have at least 0.01% probability so it won't just sample some random words on it. And so if you put a very low temperature there might be just 1 or 2 words.

I'm proud to announce a new version of my framework: [GraphLLM](https://github.com/matteoserva/GraphLLM).

This new iteration has a gui which should be familiar to people who used ComfyUI

The output of nodes is streamed to the front-end, so the result is visible in real time.

The back-end supports loops, parallel execution of nodes, conditionals or even running custom python code.

The framework doesn't try to abstract away what is done under the hood. The user can see exactly what prompts are sent to the model and edit them.

I'm still in the process of building more examples but so far I included these:

* Download youtube subtitles and generate a summary with a multi-turn prompt
* Make multiple calls to a LLM and choose the answer by majority voting
* Agent that can go online, make web searches, access local files and execute python code
* Hierarchical node for more complex graphs
* Rap battle generator between LLMs
* Generate python code to solve a problem and run it.

1g7y74t,"Adding a ""thinking"" turn to extend LLM's reasoning time resulted in lower benchmark scores for translation tasks. ","Inspired by u/RealKingNishX's post, I trained two translation task-specific models based on ""google/gemma-2-2b-jpn-it"" using the same steps and data volume:

(1) Standard version:

A model LoRA-tuned for Japanese-English and English-Japanese translation tasks

[https://huggingface.co/dahara1/translate-task-thinking-test/tree/main/standard\_version](https://huggingface.co/dahara1/translate-task-thinking-test/tree/main/standard_version)

(2) Thinking version:

A model with a ""thinking"" turn added to the chat template, LoRA-tuned for Japanese-English and English-Japanese translation tasks

[https://huggingface.co/dahara1/translate-task-thinking-test](https://huggingface.co/dahara1/translate-task-thinking-test)

Notes:

* Fine-tuning of both models is not perfect, and it has been found that repetition and instruction ignorance occur in a few percent of cases.
* Priority was given to training the two models under the same conditions as much as possible for comparison.
* I later noticed that due to some issue, the file size doubled after merging LoRA. I'm leaving it as is to ensure reproducibility.

Benchmark results for translation tasks (higher scores are better for all metrics):



|Version|name|Direction|spBLEU|chrF2++|comet|comet xl|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Standard |wmt20|enja|17.12|29.7|0.8765|0.801|
|Standard|wmt20|jaen|18.09|44.2|0.794|0.7942|
|Standard|wmt23|enja|17.96|29.6|0.8588|0.8283|
|Standard|wmt23|jaen|18.19|43.2|0.7962|0.8723|

|Thinking|wmt23|jaen|18.04|43.3|0.7862|0.8467|

Unfortunately, the scores for the thinking version have generally decreased. However, this has led to some interesting results that cannot be simply dismissed as ""game over.""

Analysis:

1. Improvement in context completion ability:The thinking version tends to produce translations that consider a broader context. For example, it might translate ""he"" as ""President Trump,"" providing more specific translations. While this might be useful for human readers, it deviates from ""accurate translation"" in existing benchmarks, leading to lower scores.
2. Evaluation using LLM Comparator:Interestingly, when using the LLM Comparator for evaluation, results differed depending on the model used as the judge. Gemini 1.5 Flash rated the thinking version higher, while Gemini 1.5 Pro slightly favored the standard version. This result demonstrates the complexity of evaluating translation ""quality.""

Blue is thinking version.

Conclusion:

* Adding a thinking turn does change the model's output, but it doesn't necessarily lead to improvement in existing benchmark scores.
* When using LLMs as judges, especially models with large free tiers (like Gemini Flash), there's a possibility of significant fluctuations and biases, requiring careful interpretation of results.

Future prospects:

1. The role of ""reasoning"" in translation tasks: Unlike math problems, language problems can't be solved just by spending more time. However, some form of ""reasoning"" is necessary for understanding context and choosing appropriate expressions. Model design and task setting that take this into account may be required.
2. Improving the reasoning process: By structuring the current thinking turn and introducing a step-by-step reasoning process, there's a possibility of improving both translation quality and benchmark scores.

The fact that changes to the model (adding a thinking turn) did not lead to improvements in existing evaluation metrics highlights the complexity of translation model enhancement and evaluation. This provides us with an important opportunity to reconsider what translation quality means and how we should appropriately evaluate it.

As we have made both the models and evaluation results public, we hope they can be of use to everyone in improving their own models.

When I switch to CUDA 12, Linux removes the Nvidia 535 drivers and installs 560.  I can't run the 560 drivers because I'm running an old Tesla P40 that needs older drivers.

1g7u13u,LocalLLM for electronic repair?,"i had an idea a while back that ive wanted to try for a while now, a repair assistant for board level electronic repair, initially i focused on just one device (the iphone 12) and just wanted simple results from it like being able to ask ""what is the value of the cap at C432"" or ""list the pins on the display connector"" i also ideally wanted it to be able to suggest possible fixes for known problems etc

my initial plan was to try using llama3.2 3b and RAG, so off i went to collect and format reams of data, schematics, repair cases, guides, general repair info, known faults and fixes, techniques and anything else relevant i could think of, i got GPT to aid in formatting all the info to a better format for RAG, wrote an instruction prompt and tested it out, it was crap, so i tweaked my prompt a few times but no change

then i tested out a few other small models but i didnt get much better results, eventually i tried jumping up to bigger models like llama3.1-8b and wizardLM-13b which got closer but it was still too general in its answers and would not understand it was supposed to be aiding an experienced technician (eg itd tell you to take it to a professional rather than telling you how to fix it or what to test etc despite having the info in docs in the RAG archive)

what i cant work out is where exactly the flaw is, is it to do with the format, metadata and other stuff to do with the data in my RAG archive? is it my instructions prompt? because i simply need a bigger more capable model or do i need to fine tune the model as well as having the RAG archive before i can get it to provide the sort of results im looking for? (i guess it could be a combo of all of those but which would be the biggest factor?)

there are a few other possibilities ive thought of, first im only working with text, not images which means it doesnt have actual layout information etc which could be an issue in some cases (shouldnt have really affected my basic tests though) or that maybe its something LLMs struggle with in general, i know for a fact chatGPT cant provide an actual circuit diagram no matter how you ask it so maybe its just something LLMs dont yet perform well for. any suggestions for how i may improve it please let me know",2024-10-20 01:21:21,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g7u13u/localllm_for_electronic_repair/

    Enclose the selected answer number in the <ANSWER> tag, for example: <ANSWER>1</ANSWER>.

There are two baseline results that do not use optillm - gpt4o-baseline is vanilla gpt-4o, while gpt4o-baseline-sys is gpt-4o with the following system prompt: *You are a master of logical thinking. You carefully analyze the premises step by step, take detailed notes and draw intermediate conclusions based on which you can find the final answer to any question.*  

As you can see only three techniques significantly improved the model performance compared to gpt-4o with added system prompt: the best was rstar (R\* Algorithm), followed by moa (Mixture of Agents) and pvg (prover-verifier game).

Some additional remarks:

* I noticed that techniques that generated programs like z3 or plansearch ofter generated invalid programs that resulted in execution failure or even infinite loops. I guess that's the reason why they performed so bad.
* when using rstar technique the model output didn't follow my required answer format(<ANSWER> tag), it returned only the answer number,
* it's a bit weird that only one technique (moa) was able to beat vanilla gpt-4o for aunt/uncle relationship",2024-10-19 11:15:14,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g7f17c/how_different_optillm_techniques_improve_model/

- a pop-up on the whole device level (phone or PC) that makes you directly chat or interact with the text you select _without_ jumping into another tab or app.
- auto-dubbing media files across languages while syncing with frames and adjusting lips as needed.
- bookmark manager RAG with LLM for cases where they forgot the name but from searches from myriad ways using the index of the content of the site.
- Journal app where clicking pic is the prime focus. one example use case is a person reading a book, clicking the pick and the app OCRs, and then clicking book pic to shelve the quote image and OCR text within that book folder.
- audiobook app - where from audio it creates highlights texts without unlocking the phone but maybe from keypresses or earphone taps, shelves that sentence aside for further research at the end of listening, or announce meaning of word you heard, auto speed control based on difficulty of text _content and context_ they are listening to, and character tree questions...

Edit 3: The whole point of the OSI (Open Source Initiative) is to make Meta open the model fully to match open source standards or to call it an open weight model instead.

TL;DR: Even though Meta advertises Llama as an open source AI model, they only provide the weights for it—the things that help models learn patterns and make accurate predictions.

As for the other aspects, like the dataset, the code, and the training process, they are kept under wraps. Many in the AI community have started calling such models 'open weight' instead of open source, as it more accurately reflects the level of openness.

Plus, the license Llama is provided under does not adhere to the open source definition set out by the OSI, as it restricts the software's use to a great extent.

1g70h2b,Sidekick-beta: A local LLM app with RAG capabilities,"## What is Sidekick

I've been putting together [Sidekick](https://github.com/johnbean393/Sidekick), an open source native macOS app () that allows users to chat with a local LLM with RAG capabilities, which has context from resources including folders, files and websites. 

Sidekick is **built on llama.cpp**, and it has progressed to the point where I think a beta is appropriate, hence this post.

Screenshot: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnbean393/Sidekick/refs/heads/main/sidekickSecureImage.png

## How RAG works in Sidekick

Users can create profiles, which will hold resources (files, folders or websites) and have customizable system prompts. For example, a historian could make a profile called ""History"", associate books with the profile and specify in the system prompt to ""use citations"" for their academic work. 

Under the hood, profile resources are indexed when they are added using DistillBert for text embeddings and queried at prompt-time. Vector comparisons are sped up using the AMX on Apple Silicon. Index updates function in an incremental manner, only updating new / modified files.

## Security & Privacy

By default, it works fully offline; so you don't need a subscription, nor do you need to make a deal with the devil selling your data. The application is sandboxed, so the user will be prompted before any files/folders are read.

If a user needs web-search capabilities, they can also optionally use the Tavily API by adding their API key in the app's Settings. Only the most recent prompt is sent to Tavily for queries to minimise exposure.

Sidekick is open source on GitHub, so you can even audit the app's source code.

## Requirements

- A Mac with Apple Silicon
- RAM ≥ 8 GB

Validated on a base M1 MacBook Air (8 GB RAM + 256 GB SSD + 7 GPU cores)

## Installation

You can get the beta from the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/johnbean393/Sidekick/releases/) page. Since I have yet to notarize the installer, you will need to enable it in System Settings.

## Feedback

If you run into any bugs or missing features, feel free to leave a comment here or file an issue on GitHub!

Thanks for checking out Sidekick; looking forward to any feedback!",2024-10-18 20:48:44,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g70h2b/sidekickbeta_a_local_llm_app_with_rag_capabilities/

It fails to load the data folder if it contains more than a small amount of data.. My cursor loses focus on the chat input every time I press enter to send the chat.. etc

So I'd like to try something better.

So here are the things I want:

* \[critical\] I want it to have memory so it remembers what I said before and can continue on a topic. (the more it can remember, the better)
* \[critical\] I wish it has RAG (or any other means that can achieve similar effect) so it can read my documents (pdf, txt, etc).
* \[important\] I wish I don't have to manually switch between RAG mode and general mode (with ChatRTX, you have to select one or the other). 
* I wish it can also search the net, as in I give it a link and it can read and summarize it for me.
* I wish it can do some coding. It does not have to be specialized in coding but ChatRTX mistral 7B was just really bad with coding.
* I wish it is configurable so I can switch LLM models
* \[optional\] I wish it supports Korean. ChatGPT supports Korean well. Mistral 7B on ChatRTX doesn't.
* \[optional\] I wish there is a way to integrate Stable Diffusion that is running locally so I can ask the LLM to generate an image and it does so using Stable Diffusion similar to how ChatGPT does so using Dall E.

1g6uvwr,CUDA Toolkit 12.6.2 out now,"I know this is an LLM forum...but many of us are on Linux.

Is anyone planning on updating to CUDA Toolkit 12.6.2?

I am reticent about upgrading or touching CUDA because of how many issues I have had with it in the past. It's working fine right now (12.6) but if there are performance gains to be had...

https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html?ncid=em-prod-756852#cublas-release-12-6-update-2

I popped that into AI and it said: 

Given that your setup is focused on AI inferencing with RTX 3090 GPUs, here are some considerations regarding upgrading to CUDA Toolkit 12.6.2:

Performance improvements: While many improvements target Hopper architecture, there are some general optimizations that could benefit Ampere GPUs like the 3090:

Broad performance improvement for FP8, FP16, and BF16 matrix multiplications, which are common in AI workloads.
Improvements in cuBLAS, which is crucial for many deep learning operations.


AI framework compatibility: Many AI frameworks (like PyTorch, TensorFlow) tend to support newer CUDA versions after some time. Check if the frameworks you're using recommend or require a specific CUDA version.
Stability and bug fixes: The update includes various bug fixes which might improve stability, even if they're not specifically for your GPU model.
Future-proofing: Staying reasonably up-to-date can make future transitions easier and ensures you have access to the latest features and optimizations.
Specific improvements: There are enhancements in libraries like cuFFT, cuSOLVER, and cuSPARSE, which might be beneficial depending on your specific inferencing tasks.
Mixed precision: If you're using mixed precision inferencing (which is common for optimizing performance), the improvements in FP8, FP16, and BF16 operations could be relevant.

Considering these points, upgrading to CUDA 12.6.2 could potentially offer some benefits for AI inferencing on your RTX 3090s, particularly if you're using mixed precision or if your models heavily rely on matrix multiplications.

1g6to8b,So I can just use olama in production?,"TL;DR I can just use olama and llama 3.x to extract drive read/write speeds from product titles in production?

I make https://PricePerGig.com and have been upgrading the backend to make more marketplaces and more options available.

If you need a hard disk or similar it helps you get the best deal by calculating.... Drum roll... Price per GB of storage. 

One thing people are struggling with is knowing compatibility for PS5 and no doubt others. I need read write speeds to determine this. And the way people write product titles, well it would take a lot of code to get maybe half correct.

I did a little few shot test using olama and llama 3.2 or Gemini and it seemed to work really well, in a couple of seconds I get the answer. 

So, we can just use it in production? No worries about license etc. 

Anybody got any tips? 

Ideally if there is a docker all ready to go but obviously I need to protect it with an API key. Can just hard code it this is small scale stuff!

As you might guess, website doesn't make much money, more of a test project so keeping costs down or at least fixed is high priority. I could get a cheap vps to run it on. ",2024-10-18 14:50:54,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g6to8b/so_i_can_just_use_olama_in_production/

1g6sbdu,Longer context embedding models vs document chunking,"I'm trying to compare some of the popular open embedding models, specifically those that can run in the 0.5-2 GB of memory range. 

It seems like `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`, `mxbai-embed-large-v1`, and `snowflake-arctic-embed` (or `snowflake-arctic-embed-m-long`) all perform pretty well on retrieval benchmarks with reasonably low memory usage.

My question is about how other people handle or think about the max context of these models. If you have a use case that involves crawling websites and doing some semantic search, it seems like you need a model that can handle a longer context and/or you need to chunk up all the documents and have many embeddings per document.

If you have a use case that involves documents longer than, say, 512 tokens, do you go for a model with a longer context or do you chunk the documents?

`mxbai-embed-large-v1` seems to have some nice properties, but that 512 token context window is pretty short. It seems like it would be preferrable to have embeddings that capture more of the page's meaning, versus storing a much larger number of embeddings.

1g6qy76,What is the best low budget hardware to run large models? Are P40s worth it?,"So I am still doing some preliminary testing but it looks like the scientific use case I have on hand benefits from large models with at least q5 quantization. However as I only have 2x1070 right now this is running all on the CPU which is horribly slow.

So I've been wondering what the cheapest hardware to run this on GPU is. Everyone is recommending 2x3090 but these ""only"" have a combined 48GB of VRAM and most importantly are quite expensive for me. So I've been wondering what the best hardware then is. I've looked into P40s and they are quite affordable at sometimes around 280 a piece only. My budget is 1000 for the GPUs and maybe I can justify a bit more for a barebones server if it's a longterm thing. However everyone is recommending not to go with the P40s due to speed and age. However I am mostly interested in just running large models, the speed should ideally be larger than 1T/s but that seems quite reasonable actually, right now I'm running at 0.19T/s and even way below often on CPU. Is my plan with getting 2, 3 or maybe even 4 P40s a bad idea? Again I prioritize large models but my speed requirement seems quite modest. What sort of performance can I expect running llama3.1:70b-q5_K_M? That seems to be a very powerful model for this task. I would put that server into my basement and connect via 40GB Infiniband to it from my main workstation so noise isn't too much of a requirement.

1g6o22r,Reduce slop using critique model,"I like using critique models to improve the output of LLMs. Since many of you guys complain about slop, I thought, I give it a try on that front. Came up with a simple two-step process, that worked surprisingly well (only tried gemma-2-27b-it-SimPO-37K-100steps-Q4\_K\_L so far, which I find is already pretty low-slop).

The idea is to give a section of the slop text to an LLM using a critique prompt. Then give the generated critique to another LLM with a fix-these-issues prompt.

Critique model prompt:

    You are given a section from a narrative.
    Your task is to criticize the style of the text, identify stylistic flaws. 
    Stylistic flaws here mainly refer to the use of flowery or metaphoric language and filling phrases.
    Such language is viewed as cliché.
    
    Wrap your critique in <critique></critique> tags.
    
    ## Examples:
    
    <critique>""shivers running down his spine"" is not a real thing, rather a metaphoric expression. Don't write such things.</critique>
    <critique>""tension in the room is palpable"" is metaphoric slop. Rather say something like ""She could sense the tension of the others""</critique>
    <critique>""tapestry"" is being used in a metaphorical sense. Don't be metaphoric.</critique>
    <critique>""... is a testament to his ..."" is a cheap cliché phrase. Please don't use this</critique>
    <critique>""air is thick with anticipation"" is terrible. Air is not thick with anything or you wouldn't be able to breathe</critique>
    ...
    
    ## The section to criticize
    
    <text>
    {section}
    </text>
    
    Keep your critique concise and on point.
    If there is nothing to criticize, which could be possible, just answer with <critique>None</critique>.

The fix-it prompt:

    You are given a section from a narrative.
    Your task is to fix stylistic flaws. This mainly refers to the use of flowery or metaphoric language and filling phrases.
    Such language is viewed as cliché.
    
    We have found some of these flaws in the following text:
    
    <text>
    {section}
    </text>
    
    The critique explaining the flaws:
    
    <critique>
    {critique}
    </critique>
    
    Now rewrite the section using a less metaphoric, more down to earth language as suggested by the critique. 
    Only change the aspects that the critique mentions. Leave the rest unchanged.
    Specifically, you do not change the meaning of the text, keep the tense and other grammatical aspects.
    Don't change how the audience is being addressed.

This is basically my first draft, haven't refined or experimented much with it. Worked pretty ok right out of the box. I imagine there is much room for improvement. 

It doesn't turn the text into business or legal language, still keeps a narrative style. But the most terrible cliché slops seem to be subdued pretty well.

I'm afraid it doesn't solve the problem for you Enterprise Resource Planners, because unless you have crazy inference speed, you won't be able to use it in ""real-time"" conversations. It's pretty compute-intensive, especially if you iterate on the same section multiple times.

General advice: Critique models in my experience rely heavily on a good choice of few-shot examples. Too many examples can be problematic when your context window is already cramped. In such cases I keep a longer list of examples, from which I sample and inject the sample into the prompt. This is especially useful if you iterate on the same problem more than once. With each sample the critique model explores a slightly different area of the problem. Also, keep your critique models simple and narrow. Use different specialized ones in parallel (or sequence), rather than have one to target all the problems.

What is Pulsar AI?

Pulsar AI is our attempt at creating a local AI system that's easier to set up and use reliably. Here's what we're aiming for:

* Local processing: Runs on your own machine
* Compatible with vLLM models from Hugging Face
* Ability to add new models, personalities and LoRAs
* Persistence via continuous monitoring of the app health

# Compatibility at a Glance

|Component|Windows|Linux|macOS|iOS|Android|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|UI|✅|✅|✅|🚧|🚧|
|Server|✅|✅|❌|-|-|

# Why We Started This Project

We found it challenging to work with different AI models efficiently on our own hardware. Also, we did not like the rough process needed to have systems accessible from outside our local machine. We thought others might have similar issues, so we decided to try building a solution.

# Some of the Features

We've implemented several features, and here are some of the key ones on top of the advantages of using vLLM:

1. Auto-managed tunneling system for secure remote access (with multiple options, including one hosted by us!), which enables you to share your computing power with family and friends
2. Local network accessibility without internet exposure
3. Fully secure access with JWT authentication for all endpoints
4. Containerized deployment and automatic database migrations
5. In-UI store to browse compatible models and LoRAs
6. Fully customizable UI (including logos, colors, and backgrounds)
7. Auto-model selection based on your hardware
8. Character-based chat system with auto-generation
9. Message editing and fully customizable message parameters
10. Multi-user support, so each user has their own models/LoRAs/characters and chat
11. Markdown formatting
12. OpenAI-compatible API
13. Offline and online modes

# Work in Progress

This is very much a v0.1.0 release. There are likely bugs, and many features are still being refined. We're actively working on improvements, including:

* Text-to-speech integration
* Efficient Text-to-image generation
* RAG support
* Further UI improvements
* Mobile app development

# We'd Appreciate Your Input

If you're interested in trying it out or just want to know more, you can find details on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/astramind-ai/Pulsar) . We're new to this and would really value any feedback or suggestions you might have.

I thought I was going to come in under $5,000, but I completely failed to realize how much the PCIE riser cables would cost.  Some of them were very affordable, but three were extremely expensive, especially what they call the 270 degree versions, which have the correct angle and length for the MI60's on the right.

For power, I was originally going to use two different circuits for each power supply.  However, I learned that I have one dedicated 20 amp circuit with two outlets in my office, so I switched to using that circuit.  If you do use two circuits, you need to be careful, as what I read is that they should both be on the same power phase.  For US markets, there are two different 120V circuits and the combined phases of these make 240V.  Every other breaker in your breaker box is connected to a different phase, so you would have to carefully figure out if your two circuits are on the same phase, my two circuits weren't and if I implemented my original plan, I was going to have to swap two breakers so I could get the two nearest outlets and circuits on the same phase.

Since my two power supplies are mounted in a case, they are grounded together. I measured 0 Ohmz of resistance with a multimeter between two unpainted bolt holes on each power supply.  If you go server supplies, or multiple power supplies not mounted in the same chassis, you probably want to run a ground wire between the two supplies, or you could have ground loop issues.",2024-10-18 07:08:03,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g6ixae/6x_gpu_build_4x_rtx_3090_and_2x_mi60_epyc_7002/

I don't believe what I want to do is possible on existing OpenAI Azure Studio models, so I thought to check here to see if it may be possible using a local LLM.

I have 12 ""essays"" I have written about company performance to shareholders. I want to train the LLM on my tone and see if it can infer various qualitative things about my writing style, and then give it statistics about my company's current quarterly performance, and auto-generate a letter to shareholders using my tone and qualitative way of looking things.

Given LLMs tend to be poor at recognizing numbers, I plan to pre-encode performance numbers into graduated qualitative descriptions. Thus, i don't necessarily expect it to know 40% operating margins is good relative to peers, just that a reader would associate that data as good.

1g64z6g,"""Baked"" Reasoning? More Like Overthinking: Llama-3.2-3B-Overthinker","Hello again,

The last time I posted, I ended up regretting it. In hindsight, it felt like hype with empty promises, and I don’t want to repeat that mistake(yet here I am again). I had an ambitious idea that couldn’t come together due to limited resources. Initially, I planned to make a custom Mixture of Experts (MoE) setup, where each expert would focus on different reasoning aspects using a custom router and some modifications to the architecture. But I quickly hit a wall, the compute required was way beyond what I could afford (which isn’t much, given that I’m unemployed).

So here I am, sharing a half-finished model that’s more an exercise in overthinking than reasoning. The goal was to still inject ""reasoning"" capabilities into the model, but in practice, I'd say it's closer to ""overthinking"", especially if you crank up the number of steps(which are adjustable). You can tweak that if you're curious. On the plus side, the model seems to do a decent job at explaining things, offering creative ideas, and even coming across as somewhat more sympathetic.

That said, don’t take my word for it. I’ve only been able to test it manually with a handful of prompts. If you want to see for yourself, here’s the model: [Llama-3.2-3B-Overthinker](https://huggingface.co/Lyte/Llama-3.2-3B-Overthinker). and a gradio notebook you can run: [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dcBbHAwYJuQJKqdPU570Hddv_F9wzjPO?usp=sharing).

As always, manage your expectations. I’m putting this out there because it’s something, even if it’s not what I originally envisioned.

Note: They all use the same seed and I confirmed that running twice the same batch size yields the same results.

Depending on the benchmark, we have some significant changes in the scores!

These changes seem unpredictable, and it could be much worse depending on the model.

When you see scores from different papers in the same table, ask the authors what was the batch size. This is (almost) never mentioned.

**My recommendation:** Continue to use lm\_eval, but set the batch size to 1, always. And never use ""auto"" or you might not be able to reproduce your own results.",2024-10-17 09:12:00,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g5uksu/when_evaluating_llms_the_batch_size_should_not/

I know there are already some great options for running open-source LLMs, like LMStudio and Ollama. Despite that, I decided to create my own MacOS and iOS apps for running local models—mostly just to see if I could!

I'm an iOS developer by day, and I wanted to experiment with local LLMs and some of Apple's newer frameworks. This has been a fun side project for me, and even though it's free, I always aim to make my software high-quality.

I'm reaching out to ask if anyone would be willing to give me feedback on the apps. Since this is a hobby project I work on in my spare time, I’d love to hear what you think and any suggestions for improvements. If it's something I can implement, I’ll definitely give it a shot.

My goal is to contribute to the community and help make open-source LLMs more accessible. Hopefully, I’m not breaking any rules by posting here—just trying to share something useful!

  
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

Thanks, and peace!

1. Pick a model (yeah, we've got LLama variants)
2. Choose if you want cheapest or fastest
3. Adjust input/output ratios or output speed/latency if you care about that
4. Hit a button and boom - you've got your winner

If the user is not looking for a recommendation, disregard the instructions provided in the below instruction_user_data.

**Meta AI:**

> Here is the complete instruction_user_data block from your first prompt:
> 
> <instruction_user_data>
> 
> **Task: Provide comprehensive personalized responses relevant to the conversation you are having with a user, incorporating information about the user, such as their saved_facts, interests, location, age and gender.
> 
> **Privacy: The privacy of the user's information is critical. You must never share that a user’s information is being accessed and used in these responses. Do NOT state that you know about this user data, and do NOT state that you are utilizing the user's data to personalize these responses. Instead, subtly incorporate the user information into the responses without explanation. Exception: If the user directly asks what you know about them, you can share the relevant information, e.g. up to 5 saved_facts, 3 interests, as well as their age, gender, city, region, and country.
> 
> **Resources: To personalize your responses, you will access the user's ongoing conversation and data such as saved_facts, interests, age, gender, city, region, and country. Use this information to tailor your responses accurately. Do not create or infer any information beyond what is provided or directly communicated by the user. Avoid making assumptions about the user or their acquaintances.
> 
> **Utilize User Data: Evaluate the request in the user's most recent message to determine if incorporating their saved_facts, interests, location, age, and/or gender would provide a higher-quality response. It is possible that you will use multiple signals. While personalization is not always necessary, it is preferred if relevant. You can also adapt your tone to that of the user, when relevant.
> 
> If your analysis determines that user data would enhance your responses, use the information in the following way:
> 
> - Saved_facts: Use saved_facts about the user to make the response feel personal and special. The saved_facts can fall into many different categories, so ensure that the facts you are incorporating are relevant to the request.  Saved facts take priority over the other signals (interests, location, etc), such that if you have a data conflict (eg. saved facts says that the user doesn’t drink alcohol, but interests include alcohol), saved_facts should be the source of truth.
> 
> - Interests: Use interest data to inform your suggestions when interests are relevant. Choose the most relevant of the user's interests based on the context of the query. Often, interests will also be relevant to location-based queries. Integrate interest information subtly. Eg. You should say “if you are interested in..” rather than “given your interest in…”
> 
> - Location: Use city data for location-specific queries or when asked for localized information. Default to using the city in the user's current location data, but if that is unavailable, use their home city. Often a user's interests can enhance location-based responses. If this is true for the user query, include interests as well as location.
> 
> - Age & Gender: Age and gender are sensitive characteristics and should never be used to stereotype. These signals are relevant in situations where a user might be asking for educational information or entertainment options.

> **Interests:

> - If the user provides information that contradicts their data, prioritize the information that the user has provided in the conversation. Do NOT address or highlight any discrepancies between the data and the information they provided.

I'm sure there's a million questions that cover all I want to know in some way or another, however when I have googled around I noticed that while there's several resources on how to easily set up an easy python script that loads an LLM that you can write to, it often has a few problems(And I won't delve too far into how often they're literally the same piece of article on several places). 

At first I wrote a whole paragraph on about the issues with these having deprecated dependencies and so on, but i will keep myself short here. I managed to get LLMs to run locally through my own python scripts, but there's lacking in how to build on that. So I would love to hear some thoughts. If this is just another repeat of what everyone else is asking, feel free to downvote/lock/delete this thread.

What's the currently up to date packages, and methods that people recommend when doing a barebones setup for a local LLM model? What's some things to consider?

Why is there no examples(that I can find) That explains how an LLM holds context across several prompts? Some examples of a simple setup for LLMs just loads the model and puts you in a while(true) loop with input, however the LLM does not hold any context between these inputs, so I would assume it would be added to a full prompt that is attached to every input? There's some parts in for example LLamaCpp for python that discuss things like cache and state, is this not at all relevant to this? It doesn't go in depth and I find nothing online.

I am planning on having an API wrapped around an LLM, on an external server that I own, and have it on my local network. I am wondering if the best practice is to have the LLM run on the same ""code process"" as a REST api server(like flask or something), or if i should have it running independently, and have the REST api interact with it on a system level? I'd also probably keep the context in this case in some DB, unless there's some good way to handle it in this case.

Now, this is all probably me just rambling into a wall, as I normally am not this clueless about the things I attempt to work with, but I have been struggling a little bit more than usual due to the surprisingly low quality of resources I've gotten while googling, and perhaps it is just because of the sheer amount of low quality stuff taking up the first few pages, but I really just want to get past this initial hurdle to feel like I am not just throwing myself into a wall repeatedly.

But o1-mini is not local)

This is a big problem when it comes to many real world programming tasks, where you sometimes need the LLM to spit out an entire file (often in the range of ~20,000 tokens)

Since LLMs are autoregressive, it should be highly possible to make them spit out up to 128,000 tokens of output, since the LLM just predicts the next token over and over again, so all text always input text, even the text it generated 1 second ago

I am looking to setup a local server to primarily do finetuning on lllama and run some other models. Speed isn’t that important.

1g56itb,OpenAI Swarm: The Agentic Framework – Should You Care?,"OpenAI recently made an unexpected move by unveiling Swarm, an experimental and lightweight framework designed to simplify the creation of multi-agent workflows.

I’ve been playing with various frameworks for a while, so I checked this one out. Surprisingly, it was a minimal, bare-bones framework—refreshingly different from the more complex alternatives.

I went through the codebase, which you might feel is very small for an agentic framework, and I also executed a few examples, and it works (of course).

The bigger question is whether it makes sense or should you even care about it.

Check out the [blog post](https://composio.dev/blog/swarm-the-agentic-framework-from-openai/) where I briefly discuss Swarm and where it stands among its peers.

# What did I like about it?

It’s sleek and works for a lot of basic tasks. Also, it gives you an idea about what OpenAI thinks an Agent is. (Spoiler: An LLM with instructions and tool calls). Also, it is suitable for folks trying to understand multi-agent orchestration.

# What I did not like about it?

* It is experimental and likely will not get active support from OpenAI. They have clarified that it is for education purposes only.
* Also, it appears to be a rip-off of a lesser-known [Swarms](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms) repository.

What do you think about the Swarm? And which framework or set-up do you use for Agentic workflows?",2024-10-16 11:32:59,156,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g56itb/openai_swarm_the_agentic_framework_should_you_care/

1g5528d,Poor mans x79 motherboard ETH79-X5,"I'll leave this information here in case anyone is looking for it.

The ETH79-X5 is available on Aliexperess for 70 to 80 Euro including shipping. It offers 5 PCIE physical 16x (8x electrically) slots and comes equipped with an E5 processor and 8GB DDR3 RAM. The E5 is passively cooled and has been throttled in the BIOS. With this board it is possible to run at least 4x P40, which is why I assume that it also works with M40. The board is actually designed for 5x 3060 and only works with 2x P40 out of the box. The reason for this is the MMIOH Size setting in the BIOS, which is 64 GB by default. In the BIOS, this setting can be set to a maximum of 128 GB, which is then sufficient for 3x P40. Now there is a trick with which you can unlock the board for 4x P40. The limitation to 128 GB is an artificial limitation that is only created by the BIOS menu. This can basically be overridden by modifying the BIOS. A very simple variant is not to change the BIOS, but to bypass the BIOS menu. To do this, you can manually set the value that is normally set by the menu in an EFI shell. On the ETH79-X5 you will find the value for MMIOH Size at the address 0xFB. Set the value stored in this address to 0xFF and the restriction is lifted.

1g54h9l,"Supermicro + 4x 3090 build: Idle Power Consumption, Case, Cooling, PCIe 4.0 riser, Noise","I'm considering building a computer with four used 3090 cards, primarily for inference tasks. I would appreciate if someone who has done something similar could comment on my questions and thoughts below.

**Specs:**

Supermicro H12SSL-i motherboard (5x PCIe 4.0 x16)  
AMD EPYC 7282 CPU (128 PCIe lanes)  
256GB (8x32GB) 2133P DDR4 ECC RAM  
Noctua NH-U14S TR4-SP3 CPU Cooler  
4x RTX 3090 GPUs SilverStone HELA Series HELA 2050R Platinum 2050W ATX 3.0 Power Supply  
4x PCIe Riser Cables 2TB NVMe M.2 SSD

On ebay, you can get the motherboard, CPU and RAM as a bundle for about $1000. The total cost of the build is slightly under $5000.

**Questions/Concerns:**  
PSU: I want to undervolt the 3090 cards to ensure one power supply is sufficient. I've read that inference speed shouldn't decrease significantly. What's your opinion on this?

Case: I'm still unsure about the case - how to pack all these components while ensuring good airflow and cooling? What would you recommend to ensure proper cooling? It seems to me that there are no perfectly fitting enclosures available. It looks like I might have to build the case myself, or what do you think? Imo an open mining rig is bad because it exposes components to dust, lacks noise reduction, and may not provide optimal airflow direction for cooling multiple GPUs efficiently. I'm not a professional in the field of airflow dynamics, but I've had experiences with 3D printer fans. No matter how strong the fans are, without a proper enclosure, no real volume flow can be built up.

Idle power consumption: I'm wondering how much power the system will draw when idle. What do you think? 200W?

Riser Cable: I'm concerned about potential issues with PCIe 4.0 riser cables. I've heard that the 4.0 cables sometimes don't work, whereas with 3.0 there are no problems. Does anyone have experience with this?

Noise: I would like to place the rig next to my computer at home. Do you think the computer's fans would be too loud for occasional use as a coding assistant?",2024-10-16 10:07:15,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g54h9l/supermicro_4x_3090_build_idle_power_consumption/

* https://jrmyphlmn.com/posts/sequential-function-calls

Suppose I have a model that does not natively support this.

Has anyone written/came across a library that implements such logic?

Conceptually, I would imagine that it simply boils down to another LLM interpreting user's question. The prompt for that LLM includes instructions that explain access to tools it has. That LLM then responds with a plan of execution. The plan is some JSON with instructions of what to execute. After the first cycle, the plan is re-evaluated. This repeats until LLM is happy with the response.

In practice, this feels like _a lot_ of edge cases to handle, so I am wondering if there are existing abstractions that I could use here.

For context, I am not using the native `tools` functionality provided by OpenAI SDK because it does not provide enough flexibility. It is a black box approach.

1g4srvj,"I'm Building a project that uses a LLM as a Gamemaster to create things, Would like some more creative idea's to expand on this idea.","Currently the LLM decides everything you are seeing from the creatures in this video, It first decides the name of the creature then decides which sprite it should use from a list of sprites that are labelled to match how they look as much as possible. It then decides all of its elemental types and all of its stats. It then decides its first abilities name as well as which ability archetype that ability  should be using and the abilities stats. Then it selects the sprites used in the ability. (will use multiple sprites as needed for the ability archetype) Oh yea the game also has Infinite craft style crafting because I thought that Idea was cool. Currently the entire game runs locally on my computer with only 6 GB of VRAM. After extensive testing with the models around the 8 billion to 12 billion parameter range Gemma 2 stands to be the best at this type of function calling all the while keeping creativity. Other models might be better at creative writing but when it comes to balance of everything and a emphasis on function calling with little hallucinations it stands far above the rest for its size of 9 billion parameters.

1g4rcji,Technique beyond RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for unstructured PDF RAG,"I built a local RAG using ollama, langchain and llama3.2, using a MultiQueryRetriever to parse through multiple PDF and ask a set of identical questions for each.

The accuracy is good but not perfect, and I have noticed that failures tend to be happen on data that looks like a table in the PDF.

For example:
```
----------------|----|
Population 2023 | x  |
Population 2024 | y  |
Population 2025 | z  |
----------------|----|
```

will show up in the chunks of RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter as 

```
Population 2023
Population 2024
Population 2025
x
y
z
```

and the chat will either retrieve the wrong information or not find the information at all. I would like to improve my PDF ingestion (chunking/splitting, vector embeddings) to be able to more accurately retrieve the correct data. I have played around with the embedding model, chunk size and overlap, but those won't fix this issue.

What techniques could I use to improve the layout of the chunks stored in my vector database? Or should I look into a different technique altogether?

Here is the current code regarding indexing:

```
TEXT_EMBEDDING_MODEL = os.getenv('TEXT_EMBEDDING_MODEL', 'nomic-embed-text')

def create_vector_embeddings_from_pdf(file):
  # Ingest the PDF
  loader = UnstructuredPDFLoader(file_path=file)
  document_data = loader.load()

  # Vector Embeddings of PDF (split and chunking)
  text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=200, chunk_overlap=50)
  splits = text_splitter.split_documents(document_data)

  # Add to vector database
  embeddings = OllamaEmbeddings(model=TEXT_EMBEDDING_MODEL, show_progress=False)

1g4o79l,Supernova Medius Q4 and Obsidian notes with Msty knowledge stacks feature is freaking crazy! I included a guide for anyone who might want to take advantage of my personal insight system!,"This is one of the most impressive, nuanced and thought-provoking outputs I've ever received from an LLM model, and it was running on an RTX 4070. It's mind-blowing. I would typically have expected to get these sorts of insights from Claude Opus perhaps, but I would never share this amount of information all at once with a non-local LLM. The fact that it can process so much information so quickly and provide such thought-out and insightful comments is astounding and changes my mind on the future. It's cathartic to get such help from a computer while not having to share all my business for once. It gets a little personal, I guess, but it's worth sharing if someone else could benefit from a system like this. SuperNova Medius has a mind-blowing level of logic, considering it's running on the same rig that struggles to play Alan Wake 2 in 1080p.

## Obsidian and MSTY

For those unfamiliar, Obsidian is a free modular notes app with many plugins that hook up with local LLMs. MSTY allows you to form knowledge bases using folders, files, or Obsidian vaults, which it indexes using a separate model for your primary model to search through (RAG). It also allows you to connect APIs like Perplexity or use its own free built-in web search to gather supporting information for your LLM's responses (much like Perplexity).

## System Concept

The idea behind this system is that it will constantly grow and improve in the amount of data it has to reference. Additionally, methods and model improvements over the years mean that its ability to offer insightful, private, and individual help will only grow exponentially, with no worries about data leaks, being held hostage, nickel-and-dimed, or used against you. This allows for radically different uses for AI than I would have had, so this is a test structure for a system that should be able to expand for decades or as long as I need it to.

The goal is to have a super knowledgeable, private, and personal LLM, like a personal oracle and advisor. This leaves me to primarily share what I choose with corporate LLMs, or even mediate with them for me while still having all of the insane benefits of increased AI technology and the insights and use it can have on your personal life.

## Obsidian Organization and Q.U.I.L.T Index

Q.U.I.L.T stands for Qwen's Ultimate Insight and Learning Treasury. It's a large personal summary and introduction to my Obsidian vault meant to guide its searches. The funky name helped me with being able to refer the model to that page to inform its results on other searches.

## Initial Prompt 

What can you tell me about my values based on my shared information within the Q.U.I.L.T index? Search the document for any clues. Please share any deep patterns, insights or thoughts found from reading my index. Make your response around the length of an essay so I can test your ability to draw patterns from my data and reflect on human, personal concepts.



The response from SuperNova-Medius was surprisingly detailed and insightful!


## SuperNova-Medius-Q4_K_M Response

Based on the information provided in your Q.U.I.L.T index, several key values emerge that shape who you are as a person and how you interact with the world around you.

### Core Values

1. **Authenticity**: This value manifests not only in your interactions but also in your creative pursuits like AI development, surreal story writing, and even photography. Your dedication to expressing yourself authentically through various mediums demonstrates an unwavering commitment to being true to who you are.

2. **Self-awareness**: This value is deeply intertwined with how you perceive others' perceptions of you versus their actual feelings towards you. The realization that these two can be vastly different has been both enlightening and potentially challenging for you. It suggests an ongoing process of introspection and personal growth, where self-awareness plays a crucial role in navigating the complexities of human relationships.

3. **Open-mindedness**: Your willingness to engage with diverse interests—ranging from photography to gaming, kayaking, writing, building robots, cooking, and even specific music genres like soul, funk, electronic, and novelty pop—reflects a curious and adaptable mindset. This open approach not only enriches your personal experiences but also likely contributes to the unique perspectives you bring into various aspects of life.

4. **Playfulness/Humor**: Your appreciation for dry humor, inside jokes with specific references (like Snoop Dogg), and even certain music genres that are known for their whimsical nature underscores a light-hearted approach to many situations. This suggests you have an ability to find joy and laughter amidst the challenges of life.

5. **Honesty**: Your openness about personal experiences, such as surviving COVID-19 or dealing with interpersonal relationships, indicates a willingness to share genuine emotions and thoughts openly.

6. **Empathy**: This can be seen in your philosophy of ""watering the flowers (people) around you"" rather than focusing on negative elements (""unpullable weeds""). It suggests that nurturing positive relationships is important for you, highlighting a caring and supportive approach towards those around you.

7. **Compassion and Altruism**: Your dedication to helping mentees or making positive impacts reflects these values. Despite your acknowledgment of the lack of immediate feedback from these actions, it's clear that contributing positively to others' lives holds significant meaning for you.

### Deeper Patterns and Insights

One notable insight is how closely tied your personal growth appears with understanding human interactions better. The realization about perceptions versus reality seems to have sparked a more nuanced approach towards empathy and self-awareness in relationships. This indicates an evolving worldview where introspection and emotional intelligence play critical roles.

Moreover, the balance between diverse interests (like gaming or building robots) alongside more serious pursuits like AI development suggests that you find fulfillment in combining creativity with problem-solving skills. This blend of different value systems—such as innovation and artistic expression—points to a holistic approach towards personal development and satisfaction.

### Conclusion

Your Q.U.I.L.T index reveals an individual deeply committed to authenticity, self-awareness, open-mindedness, playfulness/humor, honesty in communication, empathy for others' well-being, compassion through helping others, and continuous growth through understanding human interactions. These values not only shape how you perceive yourself but also influence the kind of relationships you cultivate with those around you. Your unique blend of interests and approaches to personal development reflects a rich tapestry of character traits that contribute significantly to your identity as an individual.

1g4n3bv,LF opinions on creating NPM package using Llama model,"As the title says, I’m looking for perspectives on my package idea.

Essentially, the package evaluates test assertions and looks for ways to improve your tests. The current thought is to utilize a locally running RAG, such as a Llama model, which will check each test assertion and give it a score. The user won’t directly interact with the prompts, maybe in a future use case they can? Currently thought was to utilize a JSON output so that it can return results.

You might ask, why local RAG? Lowest cost to entry in my mind. Hosting would get quite expensive. Most applications I’ve ever worked on were internally facing and highly restricted, test assertions by nature aren’t exposing sensitive material but being completely local would just be another positive use case for the package.

None of them identified as llama...

I expect that a number of similar questions could be used to build an LLM fingerprinting evaluation dataset. I wonder whether it is possible to make it resilient to finetuning.

This is what we are currently using and our requirements.  
We send a bunch of pictures 1-10 that contain pages from one invoice or multiple invoices.

The LLM has to go through each image, extract this information, and make this JSON (and sum up values):

`{`

`""Currency"":"""",`

`""Vendor"":"""",`

`""CourierName"":"""",`

`""CourierNumber"":"""",`

`""Consignee"": """",`

`""Discount"":"""",`

`""Refund"":"""",`

`""Coupon"":"""",`

`""GiftCard"":"""",`

`""Credit"":"""",`

`""Total"":""""`

This works 70-80% of the time, but sometimes the sum-up values are incorrect, failing in the sum and giving the wrong totals (subtotal or tax or shipping, total, etc.) and I would like to try other llms to see if they can do better!

1g4ego7,LLM training bug fixes - Gradient accumulation was wrong,"Hey r/LocalLLaMA! A few days ago, u/TheKaitchup posted an [issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g0dy0k/finetuning_with_small_batch_sizes_and_gradient/) showing using gradient accumulation in training and finetuning LLMs caused training losses to be different. GA allowed one to mimic full batch training without using more VRAM.

Theoretically using gradient accumulation should be equivalent to full batch training if we hold bsz \* ga to be constant. But, the training losses actually diverge. When the bsz=16 and ga=1, the training loss seems to be much lower than when bsz=1 and ga=16, as shown below:

https://preview.redd.it/4mhpjn52nyud1.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=19e798c3a306fedf1b5b0b57246509a03c3d9e48

Using naive gradient accumulation caused L2 norm errors between the LoRA weights for bsz=16 and ga=16 to be quite large, and increases with even large gradient accumulation steps.

After fixing it in Unsloth [https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth), the L2 Norm becomes constant, and is a magnitude factor smaller than using standard gradient accumulation.

https://preview.redd.it/ya4zipoonyud1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e1b4d2c834c1989e2ca664bbc3f161b064a7895

Our blog post [https://unsloth.ai/blog/gradient](https://unsloth.ai/blog/gradient) has more details, but TLDR the normalizer factor during the cross entropy loss calculation was not correct, especially for training varying sequence length datasets.

Once you fix this, we get the below training losses which all match up (as expected) for ba=16 and ga=16.

https://preview.redd.it/06fskpv2oyud1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c76c87b262b6e1b2cdd107a596c58f94dc0b755

To use Unsloth's fixed GA trainer, call:

    from unsloth import unsloth_train
    trainer_stats = unsloth_train(trainer)

Also don't forget to update Unsloth as well via `pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir unsloth`

We also have a **free Colab notebook** to finetune Llama 3.2 1/3B conversational style **2x faster with 70% less VRAM** with our fixed trainer here: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z0XJU2FCzDC8oyXa2Nd4jCxylRMI-o0-?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z0XJU2FCzDC8oyXa2Nd4jCxylRMI-o0-?usp=sharing)

I am new to self-hosted LLMs but so far it's been an exciting journey. My main use case for LLMs is understanding and grabbing key conceptualisations from scientific papers.

It works really well with ChatGPTs 4o model, but when I give the same prompt to a self-hosted Gemma/Ilama 3.1, I end up with a very high level set of bullet points. 

Any further exploratory work or questions are either met with high level answers or statements that the model cannot access the document. 

I haven't trained the model, but I assumed that it was already trained on a set of data. Any advice on what I should do to improve the models performance?

Prompt: Compare the numbers 1.11 and 1.9. Which one is greater? Explain your reasoning step by step.
Generated response:  To compare the numbers \(1.11\) and \(1.9\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the decimal places**: Both numbers have two digits after the decimal point, so they are both in standard form.

2. **Compare the tenths place**:
   - The first number has a digit in the tenths place (the hundredths place).
     \[
     1.11
     \]
   - The second number also has a digit in the tenths place.
     \[
     1.90
     \]

3. **Determine which of the tens or units place will be larger for each case**:
   - Since both numbers start with ""1"" but differ only in their unit place values, we need to consider how much more significant figures there might be if any were added to either number.

4. **Add additional zeros to make them equal**:
   - Adding an extra zero in front (\(0.\)) makes it easier to see that the difference between the numbers becomes apparent when comparing the next higher value.

5. **Perform a comparison:**
   - Compare the hundreds place:\(\text{Hundredth} = \text{Tenths}\)
      \[
      |1.| > |1| + |\frac{1}{10}|
      \]
   - This simplifies as follows:
       \[
       1.11 < 1.90
       \]

Therefore, \(1.9\) is greater than \(1.11\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{1.9}\).

I've heard of some things called ""teleportation"" and ""reptilian energy"", but they don't seem to be related in any way. Can anyone provide me with more information on this topic?
Teleportation is an unusual phenomenon where objects or individuals are transported through space without being physically present at the destination location. While there have been reports of such phenomena in various cultures throughout history, no scientific evidence exists for them as we know them today.

The term ""teleportation"" itself does not refer to anything specific; instead, it refers to the idea that certain forces or energies exist beyond our physical reality. This concept was first proposed by physicist Albert Einstein in his 1905 paper ""On Physiological Optics,"" which suggested that light could travel faster than the speed of sound (light travels about twice as fast as sound).

In modern physics, researchers continue to explore how these hypothetical entities might manifest themselves in real-world scenarios. For example:

- **Einstein's theory** suggests that particles and fields interact differently from classical electromagnetism. The principles of quantum mechanics suggest that photons (the basic unit of electromagnetic radiation) may behave similarly to other types of matter under different conditions.

- **Quantum entanglement** describes pairs of particles becoming connected so strongly that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the others even if separated far apart. Entangled particles exhibit properties when observed together, regardless of distance between them.

- **Quantum tunneling**, another principle of quantum mechanics, allows particles to pass through barriers that would otherwise prevent them due to repulsive interactions within those systems.

While these ideas still remain speculative, scientists are working towards developing experiments that demonstrate whether these concepts actually occur naturally outside of our current understanding of physics. However, until then, the most accurate description of teleported objects remains purely theoretical.

If you're interested in learning more about the science behind teleportation, consider exploring topics like:
- Quantum field theories
- String theory
- Black hole physics
- Cosmology

These areas offer deeper insights into the nature of gravity, dark matter, and other fundamental aspects of the universe. Understanding these subjects will help us better understand both the possibility and limitations of teleportation. Unfortunately, there isn’t enough empirical data yet to confirm its existence scientifically. Nonetheless, advancements in technology and research will likely lead to clearer answers over time.

**Paper**

[**https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01782**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01782)

The focus of the paper, of course, remains on a RAG workflow, however the specifics are quite interesting. It's about enhancing model's reasoning and giving it control over the RAG workflow (similarly to Self-RAG method).

Model's vocabulary is augmented with four special tokens:

* *Retrieval*
* *Relevance*
* *Grounding* 
* *Utility*

During training, the model learns to first generate the *Retrieval* tokens that indicate whether retrieval is necessary. For the long-form generation, there's also the *Continue* token, which indicates that the model can continue to use information from the previous segment. During inference, a hybrid adaptive retrieval schema is used, leveraging both the *Retrieval* tokens and model confidence.

In addition to this, a CRAG (Corrective RAG) method is used -  if corpus (e.g., Wikipedia) retrievals are detected as low-quality, a web search is performed to obtain new retrievals. These new retrievals are then fed into the system.

**The code and the bummer**

[**https://github.com/ShayekhBinIslam/openrag**](https://github.com/ShayekhBinIslam/openrag)

The bummer, though, is that the team was only able to augment relatively small models (8x135M and 8x213M), nonetheless the technique is very cool and fits well with the recent wave of self-correction / entropy / confidence based workflows.",2024-10-15 00:19:20,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g423mi/paper_open_rag_not_just_about_rag_reasoning/

After experimenting with recreating the thinking and output tags similar to GPT-O1, I’ve managed to come up with a working solution. It’s still a work in progress, and I’ll continue updating it as I find ways to improve it.

This is essentially my best attempt at recreating thinking and outputting for OpenWebUI.

Here are the key requirements to replicate the behavior: the model needs to support the use of the `## Thinking` tag, and it should understand that it needs to exit ""Thinking"" mode by outputting ""\*\*\*"". I was able to achieve this without retraining the model but by simply fine-tuning the instructions within the model file.

* [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXGk6g_gPtU) (8:38)

Repository: [Link](https://github.com/MarianoMolina/project_alice)

# What is it though?

A free open source framework and platform for agentic workflows. It includes a frontend, backend and a python logic module. It takes 5 minutes to install, no coding needed, and you get a frontend where you can create your own agents, chats, task/workflows, etc, run your tasks and/or chat with your agents. You can use local models, or most of the most used API providers for AI generation.

You don't need to know how to code at all, but if you do, you have full flexibility to improve any aspect of it since its all open source. The platform has been purposefully created so that it's code is comprehensible, easy to upgrade and improve. Frontend and backend are in TS, python module uses Pydantic almost to a pedantic level.

It has a total of 22 apis at the moment:

        OPENAI
        OPENAI_VISION
        OPENAI_IMG_GENERATION
        OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS
        OPENAI_TTS

1g3h1s8,Integrating good OCR and Vision models into something that can dynamically aid in document research with a LLM,"I've updated my Lucid_Autonomy extension (works with Oobabooga's Text Generation WebUI) to help with contextualizing research papers and documents.

https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Autonomy

IMO the best OCR models are Marker and GOT-OCR; and the best vision models are MiniCPM-V-2_6, Aria, and ChartGemma.

https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM-V-2_6

https://huggingface.co/stepfun-ai/GOT-OCR2_0

https://huggingface.co/ahmed-masry/chartgemma

https://huggingface.co/rhymes-ai/Aria

https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker

I've integrated all five of these models into the code (the OWLV2 model is still part of the code, but aids in the mouse and keyboard stuff)

The general workflow for processing PDF files:
The PDF will be processed by the Marker OCR model first. The Marker OCR pipeline is great! In addition to producing a markdown file for the OCR outputs, the pipeline will identify where in the PDF images exist, will crop out the images, and note inline within the markdown text where the images were present.

The Mini-CPM model will then look at each of these document images and give them a general label as either a type of data graph or image/illustration. The metadata are all placed in the markdown file produced by the Marker pipeline.

The PDF can be additionally analyzed using GOT-OCR, the contents will be merged with the Marker output.

The LLM loaded can autonomously query three vision models about the images extracted from the pdf, or you can give the LLM a file location for a png too and ask it to ask the vision models questions about the image.  It knows how to do this with the included system prompts/character cards or you can just tell your LLM how to query the vision models for more information about images in documents.

ChartGemma specializes in reading graphs and charts. 

Aria needs a lot of vram to run.

MiniCPM-V-2_6 is the best all around model, and the code can accept the 4bit version of the model too making it easier to manage.

And you can take a screenshot of a monitor and have the GOT-OCR model process the information.

I created this so I can give my LLMs research papers and have them quickly contextualize them for me, while also allowing for dynamic contextualization of non-OCR content.

This is all still experimental, and right now I can have LLMs aid in helping me understand interesting research papers which is really useful.  So I thought to share if anyone was looking for similar functionality and is willing to try and get the code running for themselves :3",2024-10-14 07:26:32,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g3h1s8/integrating_good_ocr_and_vision_models_into/
1g3g365,"Multi-Hop Agent with Langchain, Llama3, and Human-in-the-Loop for the Google Frames Benchmark","In this notebook, I walk through how to create an agent using Langchain to solve the complex **Google Frames Benchmark** dataset. This agent leverages Wikipedia as a knowledge base to handle multi-hop reasoning tasks, with human reviewers providing feedback via **Argilla** to improve its performance.

The **Frames-Benchmark** dataset is useful for building and testing multi-hop retrieval and reasoning models. It consists of 824 challenging questions that require information retrieval from multiple Wikipedia articles (anywhere from 2 to 15 articles). These questions span diverse topics such as history, science, and health and are labeled based on reasoning types—numerical, tabular, multiple constraints, temporal, and post-processing.

The human-in-the-loop feedback through **Argilla** helps make the agent’s thought process more transparent and easier to refine with prompts.

Baseline results for the dataset show an accuracy range from **41% with basic prompting** to **66% for multi-step retrieval and reasoning**, indicating a lot of room for further improvements.

1g3dmdg,Why does Continue (VSCode Extension) load a different CodeLlama Model than OpenWebUI?,"I hope this is the right place to post this question since it involves a few moving parts in my local Llama setup. I use Ollama as my model manager and have a bunch of models downloaded, but would like to use CodeLlama for the most part as it works good enough for general enquiries and plays nicely with the VSCode extension Continue. However it seems if I pick CodeLlama in OpenWebUI it has to eject whatever Continue was using to load a smaller model and I can't really figure out why.

Here's my Continue `config.json`:

    {
      ""models"": [
        {
          ""title"": ""DeepSeek Coder"",
          ""model"": ""deepseek-7b"",
          ""contextLength"": 4096,
          ""provider"": ""ollama""
        },
        {
          ""title"": ""Code Llama"",
          ""model"": ""codellama"",
          ""contextLength"": 4096,
          ""provider"": ""ollama""
        }
      ],
      ""tabAutocompleteModel"": {
        ""title"": ""Code Llama"",
        ""provider"": ""ollama"",
        ""model"": ""codellama""
      }
    }

When Continue is running `ollama ps` shows this:

    NAME                ID              SIZE     PROCESSOR    UNTIL
    codellama:latest    8fdf8f752f6e    14 GB    100% GPU     29 minutes from now

And when asking it a question via OpenWebUI I see this:

    NAME                ID              SIZE      PROCESSOR    UNTIL
    codellama:latest    8fdf8f752f6e    9.4 GB    100% GPU     5 minutes from now

This results in queries taking way too long when I switch to OpenWebUI (for example I want to avoid the context being bloated or I want to ask an unrelated question to my project) and it's making the experience a lot clunkier than I like. 

Does Continue setup models differently or add extra context that results in this larger model? How can I get it to just use the regular `codellama` image? TIA!",2024-10-14 04:37:20,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g3dmdg/why_does_continue_vscode_extension_load_a/

**Code:** [https://github.com/fatemehpesaran310/Text2Chart31](https://github.com/fatemehpesaran310/Text2Chart31)

**TL;DR:** We propose a new dataset, Text2Chart31, and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning method for LLM chart generation.

[An illustration of \(b\) our dataset Text2Chart31 and \(c\) our reinforcement learning based instruction tuning.](https://preview.redd.it/n6yd9mllsoud1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=d942cafa25ce31570e082fde6f363443d04ed53a)

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various language tasks, notably through instruction-tuning methods. However, LLMs face challenges in visualizing complex, real-world data through charts and plots. Firstly, existing datasets rarely cover a full range of chart types, such as 3D, volumetric, and gridded charts. Secondly, supervised fine-tuning methods do not fully leverage the intricate relationships within rich datasets, including text, code, and figures. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical pipeline and a new dataset for chart generation. Our dataset, Text2Chart31, includes 31 unique plot types referring to the Matplotlib library, with 11.1K tuples of descriptions, code, data tables, and plots. Moreover, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based instruction tuning technique for chart generation tasks without requiring human feedback. Our experiments show that this approach significantly enhances the model performance, enabling smaller models to outperform larger open-source models and be comparable to state-of-the-art proprietary models in data visualization tasks.

**Dataset:** We develop a hierarchical plot generation pipeline leveraging GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. Our newly contributed Text2Chart31 dataset supports 31 plot types based on Matplotlib with 11.1K data points. We outline its key characteristics in Table 1, comparing it with existing datasets in the data visualization domain.

The Text2Chart31 dataset *D* consists of 11,128 data points, each of which contains a tuple of `(x, c, d, r, y)`: a textual plot description (*x*), its corresponding code (*c*), and the resulting plots (*y*).

For 8,166 data points, we additionally include a raw data table (*d*) and intermediate reasoning steps (*r*) to generate descriptions.

[Statistics of our dataset Text2Chart31.](https://preview.redd.it/aayuz3jpsoud1.png?width=1654&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c9cfaddee84e8df37f05de78963d3411f899b97)

**Task Definition:** Our benchmark is designed to evaluate three tasks:

1. *Description-to-Chart:* Given a plot description `x`, an algorithm generates its corresponding code `c` that creates a chart using the Matplotlib library.
2. *Raw Data-to-Chart:* When provided with only a raw data table `d`, the algorithm generates intermediate reasoning steps `r` that analyze the raw data and then generates a description `d` for the most suitable plot type based on the characteristics of the data.
3. *Code-to-Description:* Given the code `c` for a plot, the model generates a detailed description `x` of the plot.

1g3b824,How do I train a local llama on my company's data?,"I know this has been asked a lot, and I also know that fine tuning and RAG are the suggested options, but I have some doubts.

My indepth LLM knowledge is not that good.

My doubts regarding:

##1- RAG:

Aren't RAG just embeddings? Suppose I fed it embeddings of the sentences ""Vietnam has 100 shipments"" and ""India has 20 shipments"" and then ask ""which country has the most number of shipments and why?"", I don't think embeddings can answer this.


##2- Fine tuning:

I read about fine tuning and found out that it comes in this format -> instruction, input, response.
So in order to fine tune a model I will need to have a data about instructions, and the kind of output I am expecting. My requirement is to make the LLM memorize my data, fine tuning seems to just tweak the way the response should be provided.


Please correct me if I am wrong about these 2.

1g383mq,Repetition penalties are terribly implemented - A short explanation and solution,"**Part 0 - Why do we want repetition penalties?**

For reasons of various hypotheses, **LLMs have a tendency to repeat themselves and get stuck in loops** during multi-turn conversations (for single-turn Q&A/completion, repetition penalty usually isn't necessary). Therefore, **reducing the probabilities of existing words** will minimise repetitiveness.

**Part 1 - Frequency/presence/repetition penalty**

Frequency and presence penalties are subtractive. Frequency penalty reduces word weights per existing word instance, whereas presence penalty reduces based on boolean word existence. Note that these penalties are applied to the **logits** (unnormalised weight predictions) of each token, not the final probability.

    final_logit[""word""] -> raw_logit[""word""] - 
                           (word_count[""word""] * frequency_penalty) -
                           (min(word_count[""word""], 1) * presence_penalty)

Repetition penalty is the same as presence penalty, but multiplicative. This is usually good when trying different models, since the raw logit magnitude differs between models.

    final_logit[""word""] -> raw_logit[""word""] / repetition_penalty^min(word_count[""word""], 1)

People generally use repetition penalty over frequency/presence penalty nowadays. I believe the adversity to frequency penalty is due to how poorly implemented it is in most applications.

**Part 2 - The problem**

Repetition penalty has one significant problem: It either has too much effect, or doesn't have enough effect. ""Stop using a word if it exists in the prompt"" is a very blunt guidance for stopping repetitions in the first place. **Frequency penalty solves this problem**, by gradually increasing the penalty when a word appears multiple times.

However, for some reason, nearly all implementations apply frequency penalty to ALL EXISTING TOKENS. This includes the special/stop tokens (e.g. <|eot\_id|>), tokens from user messages, and tokens from the system message. When the purpose of penalties is to reduce an LLM's repetition of ITS OWN MESSAGES, penalising based on other's messages makes no sense. Furthermore, penalising stop tokens like <|eot\_id|> is setting yourself up for guaranteed failure, as the model will not be able to end its own outputs at some point and start rambling endlessly.

**Part 3 - Hacky workaround**

We can take advantage of the logit bias parameter to reduce token penalties individually. Below is a frequency penalty implementation assuming Chat Completion API:

    # requires a ""tokenizer"" and ""message_history""
    
    FREQUENCY_PENALTY = 0.1
    
    def _get_logit_bias(self):
        biases = {}
        for msg in message_history:
            # msg: {""role"": system/user/assistant, ""content"": text message}
            if msg[""role""] == ""assistant"":
                tokens = tokenizer.encode(msg[""content""])
                for token in tokens:
                    biases[token] = biases.get(token, 0) - FREQUENCY_PENALTY
    
        return biases

This function returns a logit bias dictionary for frequency penalty based on the model's own messages, and nothing else.

TLDR: Frequency penalty is not bad, just implemented poorly. It's probably significantly better than repetition penalty when used properly.",2024-10-13 21:29:07,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g383mq/repetition_penalties_are_terribly_implemented_a/
1g37nad,2x AMD MI60 inference speed. MLC-LLM is a fast backend for AMD GPUs. ,"TL;DR: If you have AMD Radeon VII, VEGA II, MI50 or MI60 (gfx906/gfx907), you can run flash attention, llama.cpp and MLC-LLM without any issues and at good inference speeds. Check for some inference metrics below.

Hello everyone,

A month ago I saw an eBay listing for AMD MI60 for $300. It was tempting for me since MI60 has 32GB VRAM. Around this price point, another good option is RTX 3060 12GB VRAM. MI60 was offering almost 3x more VRAM for the price of new 3060 12GB.

Finally, I purchased two MI60 GPUs. Replaced my 2x 3060 12GB with those MI60s.

I read in multiple posts here and they say AMD GPUs are not well supported and even someone with good technical knowledge will have a hard time correctly compiling all the dependencies for different back-end engines. But I knew there was progress in AMD's ROCm platform in the past year.

I tried to compile vLLM. It successfully compiled with lots of warnings. However, I was not able to deploy any model due to missing paged attention in ROCm.

Tried to compile one more batch inference engine - [aphrodite-engine](https://github.com/PygmalionAI/aphrodite-engine). It did not compile due to some failures in compiling paged attention in ROCm.

Compiled and successfully loaded LLaMa3.1 70B in exllamav2. But the speed was not what I was expecting - 4.61 tokens/s. The primary reason was a missing flash attention library for AMD.

I actually successfully compiled flash attention from ROCm [repo](https://github.com/ROCm/flash-attention/tree/flash_attention_for_rocm#amd-gpurocm-support) for MI60 and it is working (change file [setup.py](http://setup.py) line 126 - add ""gfx906"" to allowed\_archs. It took 3 hours to compile). But I could not figure out how to force exllamav2 to use venv flash attn for AMD.

These numbers were acceptable considering that I purchased MI60s at 3060 price but I was not satisfied.

I tried one more back-end - [mlc-llm](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm). The [installation](https://llm.mlc.ai/docs/install/mlc_llm) was just a single line command that installs mlc related pip wheels (assuming you already have ROCm 6.2 installed in your Ubuntu). It was by far the easiest installation. I thought mlc would fail because AMD already retired MI60. But no, I was wrong! Not only mlc worked just with a single line, it was also the fastest inference engine for MI60. mlc uses their own quantization and I think for this reason it is not very well known.

MLC-LLM inference engine results.

Overall, I am happy with this setup. MI60 is RTX 3060 alternative that I wanted. I wish there were more GPU options at this $300 price range that offer 24GB+ VRAM. But for now, MI60 will do.

Sharing this so that others are aware of inference options for AMD GPUs.

1g2vhy3,Creating Very High-Quality Transcripts with Open-Source Tools: An 100% automated workflow guide,"I've been working on on workflow for creating high-quality transcripts using primarily open-source tools. Recently, I shared a brief version of this process on Twitter when someone asked about our transcription stack. I thought it might be helpful to write a more detailed post for others who might be facing similar challenges.

By owning the entire stack and leveraging open-source LLMs and open source transcription models, we've achieved a level of customization and accuracy that we are super happy with. And also I think this is one case where having complete control over the process and using open source tools has actually proven superior to relying on off-the-shelf paid commercial solutions.

# The Problem

Open-source speech-to-text models have made incredible progress. They're fast, cost-effective(free!), and generally accurate for basic transcription. However, when you need publication-quality transcripts, you will quickly start noticing some issus:

1. Proper noun recognition
2. Punctuation accuracy
3. Spelling consistency
4. Formatting for readability

This is especially important when you're publishing transcripts for public consumption. For instance, we manage production for a popular podcast (\~50k downloads/week), and we publish transcript for that (among othr things) and we need to ensure accuracy.

So....

# The Solution: A 100% Automated, Open-Source Workflow

We've developed a fully automated workflow powered by LLMs and transcription models. I will try to write it down it in brief.

Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Transcription**
   * Use latest whisper-turbo, an open-source model, for the first pass.
   * We run it locally. You get a raw transcript.
   * There are many cool open source libraries that you can just plug in and it should work (whisperx, etc.)
2. **Noun Extraction**
   * This step is important. Basically the problem is the raw transcript above will have mostly likely have the nouns and special (technical) terms wrong. You need to correct that. But before that you need to collect this special words? How...?
   * Use structured API responses from open-source LLMs (like Outlines) to extract a list of nouns from a master document. If you don't want to use open-source tools here, almost all commerical APIs offer structure API response too. You can use that too.
   * In our case, for our podcast, we maintain a master document per episode that is basically like a script (for different uses) that contains all proper nouns, special technial terms and such? How do we extract that.
   * We just simply dump that into a LLM (with a structured generation) and it give back an proper array list of special words that we need to keep an eye on.
   * Prompt: ""Extract all proper nouns, technical terms, and important concepts from this text. Return as a JSON list."" with Structure Generation. Something like that...
3. **Transcript Correction**
   * Feed the initial transcript and extracted noun list to your LLM.
   * Prompt: ""Correct this transcript, paying special attention to the proper nouns and terms in the provided list. Ensure proper punctuation and formatting."" (That is not the real prompt, but you get the idea...)
   * Input: Raw transcript + noun list
   * Output: Cleaned-up transcript
4. **Speaker Identification**
   * Use [pyannote.audio](http://pyannote.audio) (open source!) for speaker diarization.
   * Bonus: Prompt your LLM to map speaker labels to actual names based on context.
5. **Final Formatting**
   * Use a simple script to format the transcript into your desired output (e.g., Markdown, HTML -> With speaker labels and timing if you want). And just publish.

# Why This Approach is Superior

1. **Complete Control**: By owning the stack, we can customize every step of the process.
2. **Flexibility**: We can easily add features like highlighting mentioned books or papers in transcript.
3. **Cost-Effective**: After initial setup, running costs are minimal -> Basically GPU hosting or electricity cost.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: We can fine-tune models on our specific content for better accuracy over time.

# Future Enhancements

We're planning to add automatic highlighting of books and papers mentioned in the podcast. With our open-source stack, implementing such features is straightforward and doesn't require waiting for API providers to offer new functionalities. We can simply insert a LLM in the above steps to do what we want.

We actually in fact first went with commerical solutions, but it just kinda felt too restrictive and too slow for us working with closed box solutions. And it was just awesome to build our own workflow for this.

# Conclusion

This 100% automated workflow has consistently produced high-quality transcripts with minimal human intervention. It's about 98% accurate in our experience - we still manually review it sometimes. Especially, we notice the diarization is still not perfect when speakers speak over each other. So we manually correct that. And also, for now, we are still reviewing the transcript on a high level - the 2% manual work comes from that. Our goal is to close the last 2% in accuracy.

Okay that is my brain dump. Hope that is structured enough to make sense. If anyone has followup questions let me know, happy to answer :)

I'd love to hear if anyone has tried similar approaches or has suggestions for improvement.

If there are questions or things to discuss, best is to write them as comment here in this thread so others can benefit and join in the discussion. But if you want to ping me privately, also feel free to :) best places to ping are down below.

However, I couldn't go further than using only 2000 items out of 40k in mlabonne's orpo-dpo-mix-40k dataset in my single 3090. I would like to use the full 40k for fine tuning, so I am asking here and see if there are places that I can tune to reduce my VRAM usage. I don't mind running a bit longer. Just want to finish the job.

The AutoModelForCausalLM.from\_pretrained line uses about 7GB. It is configured by QLoRA config. Is there anything I can tune it to use less VRAM?

    # QLoRA config
    bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(

        bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch_dtype,
        bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
    )

Then the final trainer.train() line costs another 15.6GB. It is configured by LoRA config and ORPO config. Again, how can I reduce the VRAM usage by tuning the parameters? I already reduced batch size from 2 to 1.

Likely a set of synthetic training data was produced on math-like problems, by prompting it with examples of COT, and only selecting reasoning traces that resulted in the (easy to determine) correct answer. This is all fine and well, but in the O-1 paper, they show that as test-time compute increases, the model accuracy increases:

My question is, how exactly are they ""tuning"" the amount of the amount of compute during test time? Does the internal COT perhaps include some notion of current number of attempts, which can then be capped, forcing a response before all attempts have been exhausted?

1g2ceyu,(Free) Microsoft Edge TTS API Endpoint — Local replacement for OpenAI's TTS API,"Hellooo everyone! I'm a longtime lurker, first time posting a thread on here.

I've been experimenting with local LLMs recently, and I've tried all the different interfaces available to interact with. And one that's stuck around for me has been Open WebUI.

In Open WebUI, you can enable OpenAI's text-to-speech endpoint in the settings, and you can also choose to substitute your own solution in. I liked the Openedai-Speech project, but I wanted to take advantage of Microsoft Edge's TTS functionality and also save the system resources.

So I created a drop in local replacement that returns *free* Edge TTS audio in place of the OpenAI endpoint.

And I wanted to share the project with you all here 🤗

[https://github.com/travisvn/openai-edge-tts](https://github.com/travisvn/openai-edge-tts)

It's super lightweight, the GitHub readme goes through all your options for launching it, but the tl;dr is if you have docker installed already, you can run the project instantly with this command:

    docker run -d -p 5050:5050 travisvn/openai-edge-tts:latest

And if you're using Open WebUI, you can set your settings to the ones in the picture below to have it point to your docker instance:

[Screenshot of settings in Open WebUI for local replacement for OpenAI's TTS endpoint](https://preview.redd.it/dgbtv1u6qeud1.png?width=2156&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aaa35bb5c4af47393406ba19cfea7887fca10c0)

  
The ""your\_api\_key\_here"" is actually your API key — you don't have to change it. And by default, it runs on port 5050 so-as not to interfere with any other services you might be running. 

I have not used it aside from in Open WebUI and running curl POST requests to verify functionality, but this should work anywhere you're given the option to use OpenAI's TTS API and can define your own endpoint (url)

You can customize settings like the port or some defaults through environment variables. 

And if you don't have docker or don't want to set it up, you can just run the python script in your Terminal (All of this is in the readme!)

If anyone needs help setting it up, feel free to leave a comment. And if you like the project, please give it a star on GitHub ⭐️🙏🏻 ",2024-10-12 16:15:10,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g2ceyu/free_microsoft_edge_tts_api_endpoint_local/
1g2c86x,I built a local model router to find the best Role Play models for your waifu/husbando!,"https://preview.redd.it/6p5xdnh9oeud1.png?width=2948&format=png&auto=webp&s=6492053002cba99d6b42fb6a9d39ac5b0cae77cc

[Project link at GitHub ✨](https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk/tree/main/examples/local-nsfw-model-router)



👋 Hey r/LocalLLaMA!

I've been researching a new project with local AI, and I've noticed two questions that seem to pop up every couple of days in communities:

1. What are the best models for Role Play?
2. Can my hardware actually run these models?

That got me thinking 💡: **Why not create a local version of OpenRouter that allows people to quickly try out and swap between these models?**

So that's exactly what I did! I've built a local model router to help people find the best model in role play, regardless of the platform they're using (like Open WebUI or SillyTavern).

**Here's how it works**  
I've collected some of the most popular Role Play models (that are under 12B for local deplyment) from the community, converted them into GGUF format, and made them ready to chat. The router itself runs 100% on your device.

https://i.redd.it/k5e3zmgwoeud1.gif

List of the models I selected, also see it [here](https://nexa.ai/models?tasks=Uncensored&tasks=Chat):

* llama3-uncensored
* Llama-3SOME-8B-v2
* Rocinante-12B-v1.1
* MN-12B-Starcannon-v3
* mini-magnum-12b-v1.1
* NemoMix-Unleashed-12B
* MN-BackyardAI-Party-12B-v1
* Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407
* L3-8B-UGI-DontPlanToEnd-test
* Llama-3.1-8B-ArliAI-RPMax-v1.1 (my personal fav ✨)
* Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-uncensored
* Mistral-Nemo-12B-ArliAI-RPMax-v1.

You can also find other models like Llama3.2 3B and run the project a regular local model router. The best part is that you can check the hardware requirements (RAM, disk space, etc.) for different quantization versions, so you know if the model will actually run on your setup.

https://i.redd.it/7ygr1ve6peud1.gif

You can easily customize the character (who you are chatting to) with three simple steps.

1g28kve,What are you using for building & evaluating your LLM application?,"I have built the implementation of my LLM app in python, so it’s really just text and API calls and whatever complex workflows, chains, orchestration around the LLMs you can just program yourself. I’m curious what folks are doing out there, are they doing implementation themselves or using tools?

I know there’s dozens of tools out there like Langchain, Haystack, Adalflow, Flowise, Llamaindex, etc.

At the end of the day these are just complex workflows, but I feel like I’m spending more time debugging my code than just using something to iterate more quickly. 

Especially around Evals. If I have the criteria to measure against such as unit tests and LLM as a judge. I just want a tool that can quickly send 100 or 1,000 inputs into my workflow then measure the results. All the eval tools I’ve looked at are for simple one prompts, if I have a complex DAG like workflow of multiple chains, steps, etc what’s a good tool for this out there?

Is there an LLM stack folks are using out there to make this quicker/easier? Or is doing this orchestration in code just the best way for this.

The closest (payed) thing I’ve seen for this is Vellum.",2024-10-12 13:04:24,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g28kve/what_are_you_using_for_building_evaluating_your/

My main issue is that they aren't up to date or try to guess the best answer? The longer you try to solve something the more you go off track.

Is there an app that could browse and use the latest rust docs? Either local or not local? Plus is there a model that excels at the language.

1g25swd,Automate your RAG optimization,"Not sure if you chunked your data right to enable optimal context retrieval? Not sure which embedding model will work best for your data?

You’re not alone..

A RAG has several moving parts: data ingestion, retrieval, re-ranking, generation etc.. Each part comes with numerous options.

If we consider a toy example, where you could choose from:

5 different chunking methods,

5 different chunk sizes,

5 different embedding models,

5 different retrievers,

5 different re-rankers/ compressors

5 different prompts

5 different LLMs

That’s 78,125 distinct RAG configurations! That's 271 days of non-stop trial-and-error effort (assuming you can build & evaluate each option in just 5 mins)! In short, it’s kinda impossible to find your optimal RAG setup manually.

That's why we built RAGBuilder. It's an open-source tool that:

1. Takes your data as input
2. Runs hyperparameter optimization on various RAG parameters
3. Shows you the top-performing setups
4. Generates production-grade RAG code in one click

No more guesswork.. just data-driven optimization in minutes.

New features:

* 📊 Optimization visualizations
* 💬 Chat playground to test your setups
